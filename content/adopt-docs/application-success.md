Thank you for your interest in adopting a PAWS dog.

Your application has been successfully submitted, and a copy has been sent to you by email for your records.

We're staffed entirely by volunteers and receive a high volume of applications, so it may take us a few days to contact you. An adoption coordinator will be in touch with you soon.

Thanks for your patience.
