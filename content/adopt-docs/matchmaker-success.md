Thank you for answering our pet matchmaker questionnaire. Your answers have been successfully submitted, and a copy of your application was sent to your email address.

_**IMPORTANT!** Please add `@pawsnewengland.com` to your safe-senders list in your email client, and check your Spam folder to ensure our email did not end up there. If you don't, you may not receive emails from our adoption coordinators._

We're staffed entirely by volunteers and receive a high volume of applications, so it may take us a few days to contact you. Our matchmaker will be in touch with you soon.

Thanks for your patience.
