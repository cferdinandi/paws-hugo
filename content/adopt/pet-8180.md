Look at this girl go - nothing's keeping her down!!!&#160; &#160;https://youtu.be/2CYm3O_1Qko
This little lady came to Paws New England all the way from Guam!&#160; One of our volunteers saw her story on Facebook and because she had experience with paralyzed dogs, she asked if we could help her.&#160; The arrangements were made with her foster mom in Guam who rescued her and cared for and she arrived in September!!!

So far since being here, Mama has had an evaluation with Dr. Silver, a fantastic neurologist and with an MRI done, the short story is there is a very good chance this girl will walk again.&#160; If you watch the video, she uses her hind legs rather consistently- it's felt with PT, water therapy and other supportive care, this could be life changing for her.

Mama is a doll - she is active, she gets along with the other dogs in her foster home, she loves the children in the home.&#160;&#160;

She's is not incontinent and will tell you when she needs to get out - she's smaller than it appear so she's quite easily managed getting in and out of her chair - and let's hope this won't be forever.

Mama came to Paws New England with donations to help cover her physical therapy for some time and thus that support will continue after her adoption.

Consider adopting this girl and watch her get stronger and stronger! Won't it be amazing when you get to finally walk her on a leash???
