<p><img class="img-photo alignleft" src="/img/hbo/hbo-julie.jpg">To meet Julie Adams is to experience the true meaning of selflessness.</p>

<p>There are few people in this world who display her level of compassion, commitment, and courage towards animals in need. Julie's love of animals started during childhood and was further fueled by traumatic events involving family members that did not share her passion.</p>

<h2>Julie's Life-Saving Work</h2>

<p>She has spent the last thirty years saving the lives of thousands of animals who make their way to her home. Most of the animals arrive to her property tethered to the front gate by owners that don't even care enough to announce that they are abandoning their animal, or by way of phone calls promising to "shoot this dog if you don't come and get it."</p>

<p>As Julie's small town of Oran, Missouri does not even have a pound, she is the "go-to" person for town officials and the highway patrol when injured animals are found.</p>

<h2>Julie &amp; PAWS</h2>

<p>PAWS New England has been working with Julie for the last three years to sponsor the thousands of dollars a month it costs to provide food, veterinary care, and supplies for all of these animals. More importantly, PAWS coordinates the adoption, transportation, and follow-up support to adopters for the dogs Julie takes in.</p>

<p>This partnership has led to over 500 adoptions in the last three years.</p>

<p>While Julie does not want any fanfare or recognition for her incredible sacrifice and commitment, we are all hoping that her role in "One Nation Under Dog" will educate and encourage viewers of the importance of spay and neuter as well as the humane treatment of animals. Additionally, we are hopeful that her inspiring segment will bring some much needed attention to some of the elderly and long-time residents of the farm that would love nothing more than a home of their own.</p>

<p>PAWS is honored to partner with one of the most altruistic and talented women in rescue.</p>
