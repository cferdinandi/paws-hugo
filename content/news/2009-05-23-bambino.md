_Bambino&#8217;s happy tail, told in his own words:_

Joanne,

These two are to cute together. I stepped on Yoda yesterday and Bambino came running to save the day, so I had to sit on the floor for 20 minutes with the 2 of them just to reassure them it was OK. Enjoy the pictures.

Thanks again,

Kathie,David, Yoda & Bambino
