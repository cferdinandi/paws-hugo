_Blackie&#8217;s happy tail, shared by his new owner, Christina:_

Hi Liz!

I just wanted to let you know Blackie is doing great!!! He&#8217;s just loves going outside to go the bathroom and exploring the yard. He loves the kids and was so excited when they woke up this morning. For his first day / night and morning he is just a great puppy. ðŸ™‚

Here are some pics from last night and this morning. Yesterday afternoon he played with the kids&#8230;then got pooped out and laid in his bed and watched Tom and Jerry with my son Travis. ðŸ™‚

Thanks for everything!!!

Christina
