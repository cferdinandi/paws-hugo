_Bonnie&#8217;s happy tail, shared by her new owner, Janet:_

Dear Jo-Anne,

Bonnie is doing well and growing. She now weighs 12 pounds. She has a long body and is very smart. She still has that adorable face.

I&#8217;m sending you some pics of her. My husband and I took her to see Santa yesterday. She was so excited by seeing other dogs there she could hardly sit still on Santa&#8217;s lap but we managed to get some pictures of her anyway.

I hope all is well at Paws New England and with you and your family.

Happy Holidays!
  
Janet
