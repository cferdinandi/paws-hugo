Hi,

Suzzie just turned 1 year old and Brady is now 2 1/2. How time flies.

These guys are so precious. We are so grateful to have gotten Suzzie. She runs Brady&#8217;s life&#8230;..and he loves it!! This year has been one of health, lots of walks, swimming and love. They can get on all the furniture by the way. The rest of our blended family has taken them along with us. If we can&#8217;t take them we don&#8217;t go. And we take some trips to Maine, Maryland and Boston. Thought you&#8217;d like an update.

Best to all,

Bob & Lynda
