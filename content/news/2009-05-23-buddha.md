_Buddha&#8217;s happy tail, shared by his new owner, Kim:_

Hi Joanne&#8230;

I thought you would like to see this. he is amazing &#8211; fitting right in&#8230; Today we went to the dog beach for the big dogs to swim and he went in up to his belly, then passed out in the tent we made him. he is perfect for us&#8230;as I type he is snuggled up next to me on the coach. Thanks so much for bringing him into our lives&#8230;

Kim
