_Cleopatra Blue&#8217;s happy tail, shared by her new owner, Donna:_

Hi Joanne,

It was so nice to hear from you. Blue is doing great and has been settling in very nicely. She is&#8217;nt completely house-broken yet but has made alot of progress.

I don&#8217;t know if I told you that I adopted a German Shepherd that belonged to a friend of a friend. She is moving to Los Angeles & could&#8217;nt take her dog. I had met this dog many times and decided that I would love to add her to my &#8216;pack&#8217;. Her name is Mia & she&#8217;s 4yrs. old. Blue seems to think that Mia is her big sister and mimics her all the time They get along great. I&#8217;ve had Mia for 2 weeks now and Blue has been with me for 5 weeks. Can you believe it?

It just keeps getting better all the time!!! I&#8217;m sending you some photos of Blue and there&#8217;s one with my male dog, Kila, then Blue in the middle & Mia on the other side of Blue. Blue has become extremely loving and affectionate. She&#8217;ll kiss my face until it becomes chapped!!! I REALLY love her so much.

I&#8217;ll stay in touch and I hope all is going well with you & the rescue.
  
Please take care & stay well

Love,
  
Donna, Kila, Blue & Mia
