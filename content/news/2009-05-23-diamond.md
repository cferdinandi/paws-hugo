_Diamond&#8217;s happy tail, shared by her new owners, Pat and Chuck:_

Hi Joanne,

I just wanted to send you an update on Diamond. I have attached a few pictures for you. She is doing great. She just finished her first round of obedience training and passed with flying colors. She is very smart. We have finished fencing in the back yard and she couldn&#8217;t be happier. Now her and her sister can run and chase each other with no hindrances. She is still very leery of strangers and even people she just doesn&#8217;t see very often, but we are working on that with her.

She is a very sweet dog and we love her a lot.

Thank you for bringing her into our lives,

Pat and Chuck
