_Fluffy&#8217;s happy tail, shared by his new owner, Kathleen:_

Hi!

Just wanted to give you an update to how Fluffy (now named Jasmine) is doing. She has settled in great, and never cried after she arrived. I don&#8217;t think she has any desire to ever leave. The kids adore her and Jasmine can&#8217;t get enough attention from the kids. She goes for a morning run with a large group of dogs that meet every morning in the open meadows. She is doing very well with her training and now takes all her walks off lead and responses very well to verbal commands and some treats. She is truly a delight and love having her. We can&#8217;t even imagine how any family couldn&#8217;t love this dog. We just guess that she was meant to live with us. I take her on hikes in the woods, which she really enjoys. Thanks for helping us adopt her. My kids keep asking me if it is okay to love Jasmine as much as they loved our last dog. She has definitely found her forever home.

Thanks,
  
Kathleen
