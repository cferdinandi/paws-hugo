Hi Ladies!

Gabby (Goldie) is doing fantastic! I&#8217;ve attached some pics of her at my parents&#8217; cabin in VT and in our house. She is really loving life. She is such a sweet girl. I think she has some food sensitivity issues, so we&#8217;ve been working with our vet and local pet store to find a food that doesn&#8217;t upset her tummy. We think we&#8217;ve found a good option now. And we started doggie day care on Wednesdays. She LOVES it. This Wednesday she DRAGGED me out to my car; she was so excited to go see her doggie friends and play all day. Her separation anxiety has gotten so much better &#8211; she doesn&#8217;t cry when we leave her in the crate for the day anymore, and she&#8217;s not following us from room to room. We&#8217;re still working on getting the cat to accept her &#8211; the cat used to be the queen bee. Now she pretty much stays upstairs all the time and only comes down to eat. Its been a slow process but Gabby has been perfect &#8211; she just wants to be friends and doesn&#8217;t quite understand why the cat doesn&#8217;t feel the same way!

We&#8217;re having a great time with her. Enjoy the pics!

Naomi
