_Henry&#8217;s happy tail, shared by his new owner, Carol:_

Hi,

Just wanted you all to know that Henry is doing very well here in his new home. As you can see from the pictures he has gotten very comfortable. He is eating everything now but still on a raw diet since that&#8217;s what he started with here.

He is a wonderful dog, friendly with everyone but a good watchdog as well. He gets along great with other dogs but doesn&#8217;t see them too often, just when we are out walking. When I am comfortable he will come back I&#8217;ll let him run on the beach with his new friends. He still goes after that cat but it seems only when he is bored and wants to play. She wants nothing to do with him and lets him know it.

Thanks for getting Henry to us. Maybe someday we&#8217;ll get him a friend but right now one dog is good for our family, he is awesome.

Carol
