_Isbaell&#8217;s happy tail, shared by her new owner, Cheryl:_

Dear Joanne,

I just wanted to let you know how Isabelle is doing. She is absolutely the most wonderful puppy. She adapted so quickly to our home and family and acts like she has been here forever. She loves her new big sister Lilly and the family cat Zoe. She is very intelligent and has learned all kinds of new commands. She was completely house trained in less than 2 weeks and hasn&#8217;t chewed or destroyed one single thing! (with a puppy, that&#8217;s very unusual) She greets us everyday with so much joy and enthusiasm she practically falls over wiggling! She loves to be cuddled and snuggle close to you. Her new grandparents love her to bits and fight over who can puppy-sit. Her nana has made her new sweaters and blankets to keep warm this winter. I am sending some pictures so you can see how much she has grown.. She is actually up to 10 pounds!

Thanks again for all the wonderful work you all do at PAWS and we wish you all Happy Holidays.

Cheryl
