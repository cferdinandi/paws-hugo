_Jack and Jill&#8217;s happy tail, shared by their new owner, Diane:_

Hello to all,

So we are all in love with Jack and Jill!! They are the perfect combination of playful and lapdog! Grace was stunned at her good fortune &#8211; not only did she finally get a dog, but two! I slept with the pups in the living room Christmas eve, and when Grace came down in the morning she couldn&#8217;t believe her eyes. After playing with them for a while they both settled in on her lap for a rest and she looked up at me and asked; &#8220;Am I dreaming this?&#8221; When she got dressed Jack kept pulling on the ribbon on her dress, undoing the bow and cracking her up &#8211; it was a scene right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. The baby was playing tug of war with a toy with Jack this morning. The dogs have been having a ball racing around our yard, scaring all the squirrels. We feel very lucky to have them in our family, they are a perfect match for us! Jill&#8217;s diarrhea has cleared up, they haven&#8217;t coughed much today and they seem very happy.

Sorry it took me a whole day to get this out, we&#8217;ve been so busy! Thanks again for everyone&#8217;s help in caring for the dogs and helping get them up here. They are so wonderful, we couldn&#8217;t be happier!

Diane
