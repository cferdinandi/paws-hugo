_Jalapeno&#8217;s happy tail, shared by his new owner, Tara:_

Hi Jo-anne, Christina, Betty and Donna,

I just wanted to send you some pictures of Jalapeno (Peno). He is adjusting great and is starting training classes this thursday. Georgia and him are still not best friends but they do lie next to eachother a lot so its just a matter of time. Today my boyfriend and I took them hiking in the woods. Peno loved running around in the leaves. He has already started losing some weight and the food i give him has made his coat really nice. He is a cutie. Thanks for all your help!

Tara
