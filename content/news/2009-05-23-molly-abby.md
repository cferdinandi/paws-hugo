_Molly and Abby&#8217;s happy tail, shared by their new owner, Liz:_

Hi,

We adopted Molly in February of 2007. We believe she is a border collie/shepherd mix &#8211; but who knows! We were looking for a black lab mix as a pal for our yellow lab Lucy, and when I saw a picture of Molly and her litter mates at Tipton, I knew we had found our new friend! Unfortunately, Molly&#8217;s 3 littermates fell ill and did not survive. Molly was the only one who made it, and I can&#8217;t tell you how grateful we are that she is a little fighter. Molly is perfect &#8211; she is smart, loyal, affectionate, and FUN! Molly&#8217;s favorite thing in the world is playing fetch, and she loves to learn new tricks. She loves our cats, and when we foster kittens here, Molly acts as a surrogate Mom &#8211; she cleans the kittens, sleeps with them and carries them around with her in her mouth. We are so lucky to have found her!!

Abby is a &#8220;foster failure&#8221; &#8211; we were supposed to find her a forever home, and we did &#8211; OURS! We fostered Abby and 3 of her littermates in our home, and we were unable to let Abby leave, so she became the 3rd dog in our pack. We originally thought that Abby was a pretty high lab mix, but now that she is full grown, we have no clue what we wound up with!! Whatever breed she is, she is a great dog &#8211; she is a typical annoying little sister to Lucy and Molly, and loves to play. She is smart, mischievous, and such a funny dog. Abby loves belly rubs and likes to roll in the mud to get her pretty white coat all dirty. We can&#8217;t thank PAWS New England enough for being the reason that Molly and Abby came in to our lives!!

Liz
