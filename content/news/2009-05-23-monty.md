_Monty&#8217;s happy tail, shared by his new owner, Steve:_

Hi,

A couple of things are evident:

  1. He&#8217;s the boss.
  2. He&#8217;s as sweet as they come.
  3. He&#8217;s got energizer batteries in there somewhere.

The boys decided that Vito didn&#8217;t really fit him and it didn&#8217;t flow off the tongue the way Max and Maggie did. So Vito is now Monty. He&#8217;s a perfect Monty. Max and Monty.

We got home and is was snowing like crazy. Max came out after being alone (for the longest time in his life I think) and couldn&#8217;t figure out what to make of Monty. Monty thinks he&#8217;s a big dog and Max has always been such a gentleman. Monty was following Max everywhere and jumping and running and flopping in the snow. He hasn&#8217;t stopped. He&#8217;s collected all of Max&#8217;s toys, plus his huge beef bone and decided that this must be heaven. Max just lets him too. I took a bunch of photos but the snow made it difficult. I&#8217;ll send some anyway. I&#8217;ve got to read up on how to photograph a black dog. Max is so easy to photograph but Monty is one big black dot. He&#8217;s got a new crate, it&#8217;s right in our family room, he&#8217;s got a new tug toy and a squeaky bone (which Max likes). He HATES to be alone. Right now everyone is eating and Max is in my office with me. Monty is squawking&#8230;now he&#8217;s quiet. Hmmmm, he&#8217;s a good boy!

Steve
