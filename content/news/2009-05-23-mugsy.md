_Mugsy&#8217;s happy tail, shared by his new owner, Jean:_

Hi Joanne,

Thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to adopt this wonderful dog. My kids were FLOORED and my 7 year old literally brought to happy tears when I surprised them with lil &#8216;mugs&#8217; as we affectionately call him. We didn&#8217;t have the heart to change his name and we really felt he looked like a Mugsy! He is the best dog I have ever seen ( even the vet could not believe our luck) &#8211; everyone stops and asks about him when we walk him, he is so friendly to EVERYONE. We can NOT believe how well he fits into our family, it&#8217;s like he has been here forever, he is so calm and happy. He spends his days playing outside with the kids or napping by my feet.

I am SO glad we decided to adopt and even happier that I decided to take the drive to come meet him. We love him to pieces &#8211; he has totally completed our family.

Thank you so much for choosing us to be his forever family,

Jean
