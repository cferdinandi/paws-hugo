_Murphy&#8217;s happy tail, shared by his new owner, Caroline:_

Hi Heather,

Hope you had a nice holiday.

I am just writing to let you know that Murphy&#8217;s tumor is completely gone! After months of trying to apply hydrogen peroxide and Neosporin everyday to the big baby, it&#8217;s gone. We were so thrilled the day I came home to him and saw that it had disappeared. He is doing fantastic; he&#8217;s a fast learner yet still a big baby. He loves his mom and dad and still gives me that look whenever I leave the house. He can sit, paw, lay down, stay, heel and even Speak now! He is usually very quiet, but once you get him going, he loveesss to talk. I have attached a couple pictures of him; perched on our bed by the window (his favorite spot), in his snow gear to go out in the storm!-(it&#8217;s a little fuzzy due to being taken by my cell) and some of him playing with his dad. He is a huge mommy&#8217;s boy, he could be out like a light and if I get up- he&#8217;s up and following me. We adore him; he can be a handful but so worth every second. I can&#8217;t believe he has been with us for 6 months already. Although sometimes it feels like we&#8217;ve always had him. Just thought I would let you know that&#8217;s he is great and the tumor is no more.

Hope you, your family and your foster doggies are well.

Have a wonderful New Years,

Caroline
