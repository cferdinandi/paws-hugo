_Murray&#8217;s happy tail, shared by his new owner:_

Hello Joanne,

Mitch &#8211; now Murray &#8211; is doing very well. He&#8217;s a darling dog- very affectionate, mellow but playful at times, and very loyal, as he was billed. He has bonded very nicely with the whole family and lets the girls dress him up at their will. He has gained a healthy 10 pounds since he made his way back here and loves his walks in the woods, as well as his encounters with other dogs. An x-ray confirmed that he had badly fractured his left hind leg, probably from being hit by a car, but it is already significantly healed and should heal completely without any further intervention, according to the vet. So in short, all is good: I&#8217;m delighted to have all that searching behind us and moving steadily towards a normal dog relationship.
