_Oliver&#8217;s happy tail, shared by his new owner, Maddy:_

All,

Just a quick about about lil Oliver, now called &#8220;Noah.&#8221; First and foremost, thank all of you so very much for helping to bring Noah into my life. He is an incredibly amazing little guy. He and Joy get along just fine, despite the first attached pic; clearly, Noah is feeling at home, and has no qualms about asserting himself when necessary.

He is a miracle in my life.

Thank you all, and may you all have a blessed and safe holiday season.

Regards,
  
Maddy
