_Opal&#8217;s happy tail, shared by her new owner, Bob:_

Joanne,

Thought you might like to see our Christmas picture with a dog from your rescue. Opal (AKA Sweet Jacqui) is the dog on the left side of the picture under my daughters arm. She is an absolutely wonderful dog. You guys do wonderful things for unwanted animals so I wanted to try to show success stories which make it all worth while. This will be Opals first Christmas with us so she now has her own stocking for treats.

Keep doing great things for homeless animals,

Bob
