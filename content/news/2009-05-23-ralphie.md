_Ralphie&#8217;s happy tail, shared by his new owner, Erin:_

Hi,

He is the most amazing dog I have ever met. He is the most beautiful, sweetest, smartest most affeciotate dog. He surpassed all of our expectations. We took him on one walk and one hike today. He has not stopped wagging his tail since he has shown up. I am so in love. Thank you for taking such great care of him. I am bringing him to his vet appointment tomorrow. He just completes our family. I love him so much my heart hurts.

Erin
