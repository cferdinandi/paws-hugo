Hi,

Just wanted to let you know how Trooper is doing. Our family changed his name to Remy (after the rat in the movie ratatouille), and he has been such a great dog. He loves to go to the park with us and play tug of war. He is so affectionate and a great companion, we couldn&#8217;t be any happier. Attached you will find a few photos so you can see how he&#8217;s been doing. Thanks and take care!
