PAWS will be paying tribute to all rescue Moms this Mother&#8217;s Day with a beautiful handmade Mother&#8217;s Day Card. Each card will come from a PAWS dog that will be receiving the donation and include a photo of this lucky pup. For $25, what dog-loving Mom would not love to have lifesaving vaccinations and medications donated to a pet in their honor? Or perhaps a dog bed and blankets to keep them warm while they are awaiting a forever home for $50? And, for a donation of $150, what Mother would not love to look at a picture of a dog whose life was saved in her honor. We hope you will participate in this very special event.

**All order must be placed by WED. MAY 5th to ensure delivery in time for mother&#8217;s day.**
