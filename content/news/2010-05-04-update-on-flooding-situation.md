First and foremost, PAWS would like to thank the hundreds of people who have offered to help and sent their love and support. The response to this disaster has been overwhelming!

At 12:57am on Wednesday morning, we have fosters lined up for 38 of the 43 dogs in need. Below are links to the dogs still in need of a foster home. Some of our dogs are still awaiting heartworm treatment because of the Imiticide shortage, so they will go to local Memphis foster homes. We hope to transport this entire group of dogs in one trip via our USDA approved transport partners. Most of the dogs will be arriving in New England on May 8th. As this is an unprecedented number of dogs being transported at once, we are hoping for a month of record adoptions!

We are still very focused on the immediate emergency situation and have not even begun to assess the financial toll that this disaster has taken on our organization. As the waters in TN are receding, it has become quite apparent that the damage is worse than we originally expected. Please consider [making a donation](https://pawsnewengland.com/donate/index.php) to help us rebuild.

Thank you for your incredible support&#8230; As tired and overwhelmed as all the volunteers are- we are being fueled by your emails and well wishes.
