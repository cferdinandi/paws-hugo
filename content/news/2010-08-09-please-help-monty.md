Monty is a 1-2 year old chocolate brown pit bull who was hit by a car and suffered a compound fracture of his femur.

Partner orthopedic vets of PAWS evaluated Monty and sadly determined that they would have to amputate his leg. They also discovered that Monty does not have complete control of his bowel or bladder &#8211; an unfortunate consequence of his accident.

Most dogs in Monty&#8217;s position would have died or shut down emotionally from this extensive trauma. But Monty is one of those once in a lifetime dogs that you will find yourself talking about for generations to come. 

He has a magnetic personality and every single volunteer who has met him has fallen under his spell. He has the most beautiful and expressive eyes that look up as if to say, &#8220;Please just give me a chance. I promise I&#8217;ll be good.&#8221; 

At first, Monty had no ability to wag his tail and we have noticed that this is improving greatly. We believe with time, that Monty will regain continence, but for now he wears diapers. Sadly, it will be very difficult to find someone willing to adopt a pit bull who only has three legs and some issues of incontinence, but we are holding out for a miracle.

Monty is excellent with other dogs and doesn&#8217;t let his special needs prevent him from playing and acting like a regular dog. He also loves cats. His foster Mom said he would give them a bath with kisses all the time &#8211; he seems to love trying to take care of smaller animals. Monty would love fur brothers and sisters! ðŸ˜‰

**If you would be willing to open your home and your heart to Monty, please email us immediately at <adoptions@pawsnewengland.com>.** 

Due to circumstances beyond Monty&#8217;s control, he has found himself in need of an emergency foster home or forever home. Please help us make a miracle for this boy &#8211; he deserves it!
