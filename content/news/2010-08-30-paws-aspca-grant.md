PAWS New England is thrilled to announce that we have been awarded a $5,000 grant from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) to aid in the costs associated with the massive flooding in Tennessee that destroyed our sanctuary in early May. 

The ASPCA is working closely with PAWS to help get the organization back up and running and has been a tremendous advocate during this difficult time. PAWS is humbled this generous grant, and is a proud partner of the ASPCA.

The ASPCA was the first humane society to be established in North America, and today is one of the largest in the world. The organization was founded by Henry Bergh in 1866 on the belief that animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at the hands of humans, and must be protected under the law. 

Headquartered in New York City, the ASPCA maintains a strong local presence with programs that extend anti-cruelty missions across the country. They are recognized as a national animal welfare organization and function as a privately funded 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation.
