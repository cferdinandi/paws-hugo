Two years ago, Jean and her family [rescued Mugsy](https://pawsnewengland.com/mugsy/) through PAWS New England, and he very quickly became a member of their family.

He watches TV with the kids, lays with them when they are sick, and runs to cuddle with them if one of them gets in trouble. 

So when Jean suggested that they donate the money from their lemonade stand, they immediately wanted to give the money to &#8220;Mugsy&#8217;s rescuers.&#8221; They couldn&#8217;t wait!

They raised $93, and handed out adoption info with each cup of lemonade and cookie sold.

Every dollar counts. Many thanks to Jean and her family for their kindness and creative fundraising!
