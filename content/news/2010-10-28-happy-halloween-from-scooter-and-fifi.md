Last year, we rescued an incredible bichon-poodle mix named Scooter.

Scooter was paralyzed from the waist-down. We were actually advised to euthanize him, because his recovery would be so costly. We didn&#8217;t.

(_To learn more about his back story, check out [this video from PAWS co-founder Kelly Parker](http://vimeo.com/7301300). Skip to the 1:20 mark. Warning: It&#8217;s sad!_)

**Fast forward a year.**

Scooter is in a wonderful and loving forever-home, where he spends his days hanging out with his new sister, FiFi.
