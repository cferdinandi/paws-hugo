When we first met Oliver, he was very, very emaciated, found wandering in Tennessee, no place to call his own.

He was placed with an exceptional [foster-caregiver](https://pawsnewengland.com/help/) (_PAWS co-founder [Joanne Hutchinson](https://pawsnewengland.com/our-volunteers/joanne-hutchinson/)_), and is now in an incredible forever-home with people who have explored every avenue to make his life happier and healthier &#8211; he gets physical therapy, swim sessions and holistic treatment.

He spends his days getting treats from neighbors, relaxing with his new brother Shadow, and following his new owners around the house.

Oliver is one of those dogs that reminds every PAWS NE volunteer why we do this and how we couldn&#8217;t do it without the support of those people who love these wonderful creatures as much as we do.
