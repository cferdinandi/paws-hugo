## UPDATE

The wonderful people at [MidAtlantic Bulldog Rescue](http://www.midatlanticbulldogrescue.com/) will be temporarily fostering Arnold (and providing all of his food and medical care) while Patty gets back on her feet.

On behalf of Arnold (and dogs in need everywhere), thank you MidAtlantic Bulldog Rescue!

Arnold is an adorable Boston Terrier/Pug mix from New Jersey.

His owner and best friend, Patty, suffered a traumatic brain injury. As a result, she lost her job and her home. She and Arnold have been living out of her car.

With the cold weather upon us, Patty is concerned for Arnold&#8217;s health and emotional well-being. She wants him to feel warm and safe as she tries to get herself back on her feet.

**PAWS is assisting Patty in finding a temporary foster home for Arnold.**

He&#8217;s five years old, 32 pounds and fully house-trained. He gets along great with older children, other dogs and even cats. Arnold is a very sensitive little guy and gets upset if someone raises their voice to him, so he may do better in a house without young children.

We want to stress that this is a temporary situation. Arnold will have to be released back to Patty.

**If you can help, please contact Monica at [enlightened34@aol.com](mailto:enlightened34@aol.com?subject=Fostering Arnold).**
