**UPDATE:** Ming-Ming has been found!

Ming-Ming is a one year old Pug/Shar-Pei mix. 

She was last seen on Main Street/3A in Marshfield, MA (in the woods behind ABC Equipment). She weighs 28-pounds and is wearing a pink camouflage collar. 

She was hit by a car, and has been seen a few times in the area but runs away when called.
