PAWS New England has a lot to be thankful for this year.

Thank you to our incredible team of [volunteers](https://pawsnewengland.com/volunteer/), [foster caregivers](https://pawsnewengland.com/foster/) and [partners](https://pawsnewengland.com/paws-partners/) &#8211; without you, we literally would not exist.

Thank you to the wonderful people who [adopt our dogs](https://pawsnewengland.com/adopt/) and provide them with safe and loving homes.

Thank you to [our donors](https://pawsnewengland.com/donate/), whose generosity has provided food, shelter and veterinary care for more than 3,500 dogs since 2006. Thanks to you, we&#8217;re also able to start [rebuilding our sanctuary](http://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=ef37ec2f5d&e=5b01c4101e) in Tennessee, just in time for the holidays.

And last, but certainly not least, thank you to all of the [wonderful dogs](https://pawsnewengland.com/tag/paws-success-stories/) who have blessed our lives over the last four years. You make it all worth it.
