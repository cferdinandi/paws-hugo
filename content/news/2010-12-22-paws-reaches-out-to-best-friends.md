Many of you responded to [this story](../best-friends-hoarding/) about a hoarding case in Arkansas that left 123 dogs in need of emergency veterinary services. Thanks to PAWS foster Moms Christen Kotch and Kim OKonis for opening up their homes, PAWS volunteer Jeanne Powers for driving 12 hours round trip, and the incredible staff at Best Friends for coordinating this trip- two very lucky dogs are now spending their holiday in New England.

The folks at Best Friends could not have been more incredible and accommodating. Somehow, they managed to attend to the needs of these 123 dogs immediately and then work with rescues around the country to arrange transport. With the help of Robin Politowicz and Anna Gonce two labs April and Gina were loaded up on a volunteer transport and heading across country in a matter of days. Jeanne Powers came to the aid of PAWS yet again and spent all day in the car getting these pups the last bit of the way.

At the end of the day, April was resting comfortably at Christen Kotch&#8217;s home. Christen wrote:
