We&#8217;re celebrating Valentine&#8217;s Day with beautiful handmade cards by Jenn Frankavitz.

## Here&#8217;s how it works

  1. You make a donation to one of our wonderful dogs. Your donation will pay for vaccinations, food and toys, veterinary care and more!
  2. We&#8217;ll send you a handmade Valentine&#8217;s Day card with a photo of the dog whose life you&#8217;ve helped improve.
  3. That&#8217;s it!

If you want to donate to a specific dog, make sure to include his or her name when you donate. You can find a list of all of our dogs on our [Adoption page](https://pawsnewengland.com/adopt/). If you don&#8217;t have a dog in mind, that&#8217;s ok, too! We&#8217;ll pick one for you.

## Order Now!

We raised over $1,300 from this limited-run promotion, and are not taking any new orders.

Many, many thanks to those of you who participated this year, and an extra-special thank you to Jenn Frankavitz for creating the beautiful, hand-crafted cards. Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day!
