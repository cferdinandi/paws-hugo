Beau was found wandering the country back roads in a very rural area of Tennessee and was as thin as a rail.

He was in a very small, high-kill shelter for several months &#8211; well past his welcome as it&#8217;s very rare that this shelter lets dogs stay there for this length of time. Beau was such a sweet boy that the shelter staff kept overlooking him on euthanasia days and begged PAWS New England to take him.

PAWS scooped up Beau as soon as a foster opening was available. 

Beau has made his adoptive parents so very happy. His sweet, gentle nature makes it impossible for anyone to not fall in love with him upon meeting him.
