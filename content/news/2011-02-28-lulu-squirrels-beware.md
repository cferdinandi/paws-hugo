We love getting emails like this&#8230;

> I just wanted to send you a quick update about Lulu (formerly known as Gypsy)!
> 
> Suffice it to say she&#8217;s the apple of our eye and pretty much the star of the show. She&#8217;s such a great addition to our family! She&#8217;s smart, sweet, and hilarious. We just can&#8217;t get enough! She loves going to the local dog park, and keeping an eagle eye on the squirrels in a tree just outside our house from our 2nd story window.

> Thank you all so much for helping bring her into our lives!

> All the best!
