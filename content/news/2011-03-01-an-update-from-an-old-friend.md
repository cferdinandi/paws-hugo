Many of you will [remember the story of Campbell](http://www.onetruemedia.com/otm_site/view_shared?p=92141b9f694e09d8a1581e&skin_id=601) &#8211; an elderly Weimaraner found wandering the streets sixty pounds underweight and in horrifying condition.

Now named Oliver, this incredible boy continues to thrive in what may be one of the most amazing homes we have ever found. Joanne and Gary, Oliver&#8217;s parents, have spoiled this boy rotten! He vacations with them to Florida each year and spends his free time playing with his Weimaraner brother Shadow and lounging around the house getting belly rubs.

Recently, Oliver has had more and more difficulty walking. PAWS thought the ole boy could use some hot wheels, so we sent this wheelchair from his buddies at PAWS. Joanne and Gary say he is doing great learning how to use it and it zipping around the neighborhood!
