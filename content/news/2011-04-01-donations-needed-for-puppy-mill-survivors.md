Things continue to move at a furious pace at PAWS New England while we work to secure foster homes for 35 purebred Pomeranians and Chinese Crested puppy mill victims. Thanks to our supporters, we have secured 20 foster spots in the New England and DC metro region, raised funds to purchase emergency items like food and medicine, and found an incredible pilot volunteer who will be flying the dogs up next week. **We still are in need of at least 10 more foster spots** so please consider opening up your home to one of these very special dogs. [Learn more about fostering here&#8230;](../foster-puppy-mill-dogs/)

**Our greatest need at this moment is funding**. We have 35 spay/neuter surgeries, vaccinations, and fecal exams scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday of next week and currently do not have the funds to pay for such a large veterinary bill. We would be devastated to have to leave dogs behind, so please [consider making a donation](../donate/) to get these dogs to safety. Thank you for your support!

Both Olive and Champ are looking great after hours of grooming and some nice new sweaters! Please make a donation so that all the dogs found in these horrible conditions can get the care they need to make this transformation!
