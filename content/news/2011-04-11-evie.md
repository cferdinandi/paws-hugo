Evie was shot by an off-duty policeman who mistook her for a vicious Pit Bull. Now she&#8217;s living large with Meg and Eric!

> Evie is adjusting very well! Mr. Pants as well!
> 
> She slept through the night, a little mumbling when Mr. Pants barks, but she quiets down quickly. Right now all three of us are resting (sleeping) in the man cave. She loves her pillow bed and blanket.
> 
> Thank you for giving us a wonderful addition to our family! She&#8217;s just an adorable beautiful girl. She sat on Eric&#8217;s lap last night as if she always belonged there! He was in dog heaven =)
> 
> We are truly blessed and very happy!!!
