An update on Betsy&#8230;

> Betsy is doing very well. We are getting in a ton of walks each day and have found a really nice Skate Park in Lincoln, RI. We have been taking her with us in the car whenever we can and she does great. Today has been a lazy day she has slept quite a lot. 
> 
> She is great with everyone we have introduced her too. She is absolutely amazing in her crate, no issues at all. We have been given her a frozen Kong filled with biscuits and peanut butter and play some music when we both have to head out to work.
> 
> I&#8217;ve attached a bunch of photos and will continue to keep you updated. Hope all is well.
> 
> Thanks,
  
> Ryan & Alana
