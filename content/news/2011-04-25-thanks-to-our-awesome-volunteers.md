Last month, PAWS participated in its largest adoption event of the year at [John Gagnon&#8217;s Pet Resort](https://pawsnewengland.com/adoption-event-at-john-gagnons-pet-resort-march-20th/).

The event was a huge success! Many thanks to our awesome volunteers, without whom this event would not have happened.

Special thanks goes out to Kit and Ken Reardon and Nancy Barone, the organizers for this event.

Here are some photos from the event. If you&#8217;re interested in volunteering for PAWS, [click here](https://pawsnewengland.com/help/).
