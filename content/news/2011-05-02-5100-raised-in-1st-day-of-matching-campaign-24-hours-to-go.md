Our dear friends and great supporters at John Gagnon&#8217;s Pet Resort are matching all donations raised until tomorrow (May 3rd) **at 9:00pm EST.** Let&#8217;s make the next twenty four hours even more successful than our first twenty four hours! There were a total of seventy donations today with the average donation being $35. No donation is too small. Please encourage friends and family to participate in this incredible opportunity to double you impact!

There are currently 170 dogs being cared for by PAWS right now; all of those dogs will benefit from these donations. But we would like to highlight two projects that are in greatest need of funding right now. Please double your impact right now by making a donation in the next 24 hours!
