PAWS New England was flabbergasted today to learn that our dear friends and great supporters at John Gagnon&#8217;s Pet Resort are matching all donations raised in the next 48 hours. **From now until May 3rd at 9:00pm EST** any donation you make to PAWS will be doubled. _Twenty five dollars will become fifty dollars, fifty dollars will become a hundred dollars, one hundred dollars will become two hundred.. IMAGINE the possibilities!_ 

Please take advantage of this amazing opportunity by clicking on this [donation link here](../donate/). And please take a moment to thank the Gagnon&#8217;s for their unbelievable generosity to our organization by leaving a quick note on their [facebook page here](https://www.facebook.com/pages/John-Gagnons-Pet-Resort/243146755386).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Faces That Need These Donations&#8230;</strong></span>

There are currently 170 dogs being cared for by PAWS right now; all of those dogs will benefit from these donations. But we would like to highlight two projects that are in greatest need of funding right now. Please double your impact right now by making a donation in the next 48 hours!

Thank you for your support and a thank you to John and Sherri Gagnon from the bottom of our hearts. We are in awe of your endless support and dedication to rescue dogs in need.
