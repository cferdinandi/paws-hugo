## What&#8217;s a Whisker Walk?

Well its a lot of things &#8230; but mostly its a free, fun day for families and their dogs.

The main event is a dog walk-a-thon fundraiser to benefit animal shelters and rescue groups throughout New England. The 2010 Whisker Walk brought in more than 100 animal rescue groups, pet related vendors/manufacturers and sponsors for the first of its kind
