Back in May, we announced that we&#8217;re giving away a Red Sox fan&#8217;s dream package to one lucky donor as a way to show our appreciation to all of our wonderful supporters. By popular demand, we&#8217;ve decided to extend the date for the drawing to July 1.

**If you haven&#8217;t donated to PAWs and would like a chance to win Red Sox tickets and more, [head over to our donation page now](https://pawsnewengland.com/donate/).**

In case you forgot, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s included in the package:

  * 4 tickets to the Sunday, July 10th game against the Orioles.
  * An autographed photo of Daisuke Matsuzaka.
  * $100 in spending money for drinks and dogs.

## About the Tickets

The tickets are for the Sunday, July 10th game against the Baltimore Orioles. This is a home game at Fenway Park in Boston, MA. The seats are in the Infield Grandstand (Row 26).

_The tickets were donated by long time PAWS supporter Jeanne Powers. The autograph photo was donated by the Red Sox._
