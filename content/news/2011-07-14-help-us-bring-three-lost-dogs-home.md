Sadly, three beloved PAWS dogs are currently missing as of July 14th, 2011 and PAWS is doing everything we can to try and bring them home safely. There are many tools in place to help find lost dogs such as services that make thousands of phone calls, [send out post cards](http://www.petharbor.com/LPP_FAQ.htm), traps, trackers etc. but PAWS needs to raise funds to be able to afford such services..

Lilly is a black lab mix who is lost in the DC metro area. Lilly waited five years to find a forever home and was lost within 5 days of arriving to her new family. She is an exceptionally shy, timid dog and is quite afraid of people. Missing since June 28th, 2011 from the Beltsville Community Center in Beltsville, MD. Last seen on 7/13 on Hennessy Drive off Montgomery Rd in Beltsville.
