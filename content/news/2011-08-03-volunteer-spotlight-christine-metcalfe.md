**Current pets:** Lila, dog, female, lab/pit mix. Rosie, kitten, female, just plain cute. Rhino, rat, kind of gross, but I like him. Dirt, fish, (my son Wyatt named him).

**How long have you been a volunteer?** Since December of 2010.

## How were you introduced to PAWS?

I contacted them after finding them on the internet. I had wanted to get another dog but when I looked into fostering it seemed like a better plan. I filled out a request to foster and passed the test!

Since then I have met so many wonderful people and had some really great experience.

## What do you do as a volunteer?

I am mostly a foster mom. I try to attend any animal fairs and/or meet and greets that PAWS is going to attend to get my foster dog seen. Pictures don&#8217;t always do them justice! You have to meet them to really fall in love.

## Favorite Volunteer Moment

My daughter, Georgia, who is 7, and I spend a lot of time together because we both bond with the foster pups. She attends all the meet and greets with me.

It&#8217;s our special project and we get to spend more time together because of it.

From a dog aspect there is not one instant that sticks out in my mind. Each pup has brought a wonderful experience into our home, some quite hilarious!

It&#8217;s amazing how they open up to you when you show them love and affection (also a couch and a bed to share!)
