This is one of the best adoption events in New England. Sponsored by [John Gagnon&#8217;s Pet Resort](http://www.4dogman.com/), dogs of all shapes and sizes come in hopes of finding their forever family.

Many PAWS dogs will be present and we will be updating this post with pictures and bios of dogs that will be available for adoption at the event. Hope to see you there! If you would like to bring home an adoptive dog on the day of the event, please fill out an [adoption application here](https://pawsnewengland.com/adoption-form/) and make sure you have an approved application on file before you arrive!
