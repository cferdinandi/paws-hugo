Solo humans welcome too! Bring the whole family and enjoy an autumn day on Winslow&#8217;s Farm, a 60+ acre petting farm and animal sanctuary. The 5k and 10k races start at noon and are flat, out-and-back courses. Prizes will be awarded for the fastest finishers and the best Halloween costumes. Enjoy raffles and refreshments and, who knows, you may meet a foster dog you&#8217;d like to adopt&#8230;

**WHEN: Saturday, Nov. 5, 2011. Noon start (packet pickup from 9:30 &#8211; 11:30 race day)
  
WHERE: Winslow Farm Animal Sanctuary [37 Eddy Road, Norton MA](http://g.co/maps/h7u2p)**

A $30 registration fee covers entry in the race of your choice (5k or 10k) for you and your dog.
