For the last three years, PAWS New England has teamed up with Petfinder.com in this national effort to help empty shelters across the country and place homeless pets in loving foster and adoptive homes. **PAWS would like to make history this year by finding a foster home for every dog in our sanctuary by December 10th.**

If we are able to achieve this goal, PAWS can go to Tipton County Animal Control and empty the pound immediately before Christmas. _Can you imagine what a miracle it would be if no dogs had to be put to sleep during the week of Christmas?_

Want to help? It&#8217;s as easy as 1,2,3,4!

(1) **[Watch the Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDWZXDKvc5E)**&#8230; _Then share this video by posting it on your social networking sites and forwarding it to everyone in your email address book. We are looking to reach 10,000 views before December 10th.___
