Our very own PAWS photographer and volunteer extraordinaire [Jenn Frankavitz](http://www.jennfrankavitz.com/) has been hard at work over the last few months putting this calendar together and the final product will knock your socks off!

Calendars are $26 each (shipping is included) and make a wonderful Christmas present for any dog lover. **To ensure holiday delivery, please place all orders by December 11th.**

All proceeds raised from the calendars go directly to PAWS dogs in need. Order one (or ten!) today by clicking on the PayPal button below. You do no need a PayPal account and can charge the calendar to your credit through the PayPal link below.
