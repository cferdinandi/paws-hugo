**Profession:** Principal in a healthcare consulting firm
  
**Current pets:** 4 Alaskan Klee Kai: Kua (Aumakua), Kiki, Kami, and Takota (Kota). Kiki and Takota are rescues (Kota is also a front-leg amputee). Kami is a breeder re-home.

## How were you introduced to PAWS?

I found out about PAWS through John Gagnon&#8217;s Pet Resort, where our dogs are regulars. I figured that any organization so strongly supported by John and his team must do good work.

## What do you do as a volunteer?

So far, pre-adoption home visits, transport to events or vet appointments, and adoption events.

## Favorite PAWS Volunteer moment?

I really enjoy the adoption events &#8211; introducing the special PAWS dogs to potential adopters. It&#8217;s also a great chance to meet the other PAWS volunteers.
