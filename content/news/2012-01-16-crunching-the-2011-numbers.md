PAW New England had our ups and our downs in 2011, but we are excited to report that we ended the year on a wonderful note! <a href="../huge-news-all-donations-will-be-matched-for-next-48-hrs/" target="_blank">The Matching Donations Campaign</a> raised **$14,341.76**.

 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">During 2011:</span>

  * **474** dogs found their loving forever home through our organization.
  * **612** lives were saved from high kill shelters.
  * PAWS spayed/neutered **531** dogs. <a href="http://www.spayusa.org/" target="_blank">SpayUSA</a> estimates that this has prevented **3,914,957** unwanted animals from being born over the next five years.
  * **2,085** new facebook users joined the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PAWSNewEngland" target="_blank">PAWS New England page</a>. **784** new people <a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=2d6244b8d5" target="_blank">subscribed to our newsletter</a>.
  * **588** people made **702** <a href="../donate/" target="_blank">donations</a>. The average donation was **$68.73**.

It&#8217;s hard to articulate our immense gratitude to all of you who made this possible. To experience this level of success in a year plagued with recession, a record breaking number of trauma cases, a heartworm medication shortage, and significant financial hardship- we are simply speechless that we were able to rescue so many dogs and end our year in the black. So please accept an enthusiastic &#8220;thank you!&#8221; for your incredible support, and know that every single volunteer at PAWS will strive for even greater success in 2012.
