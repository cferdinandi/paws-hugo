PAWS invites our supporters to celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day this year with an unconventional approach; bring home a foster dog in need. There is no more beautiful expression of love than holding a trembling dog close and telling them they have nothing to fear. Or receiving a kiss from a needy pup that thinks there is no greater thing on earth than being close to you.

Right now at PAWS, there 44 dogs in need of a foster home.
