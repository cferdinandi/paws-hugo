Many of our supporters will remember our email back in early March entitled &#8220;[We Have a Situation](../we-have-a-situation/)&#8221; where 25 dogs were left at an abandoned house with limited food and water. PAWS raced against the clock to evacuate all the dogs before they fell victim to starvation and dehydration and successfully coordinated the rescue of every last one of them.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuzO9UWJgUQ) details the journey to date of these special dogs and invites our supporters to share in a few of their stories.



These pups are still in need of your help if they are to get the loving homes they deserve. The veterinary expenses from this case cost double what we originally estimated as many of these abused and neglected dogs had multiple medical problems. Some of them are still waiting for funding to get the medical attention they need. Please consider [making a donation](../donate/) on their behalf.

Most dogs in the group are anxiously awaiting foster homes in New England and would love nothing more than a quiet and safe spot in your home. By fostering, you can forever change the life of a dog in need. To learn more, [please click here.](../foster/) 

We will continue to update our supporters as this group of survivors continue to thrive and make their way into [adoptive homes](../adopt/).

Thank you for your support!
