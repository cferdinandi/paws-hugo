**Profession:** Internet Marketing & Cosmetologist

**Current pets:** 1-Adopted our PAWS foster, the famous Reggie Love! Also have a fat tabby cat at my Mom&#8217;s.

**How were you introduced to PAWS?**
  
I was looking around on the web for programs that needed fosters for dogs, especially Bully Breeds (my favorite)! I found Paws, filled out an app, and was immediately contacted by the ever-so-awesome Jenn F.!

**What do you do as a volunteer?**
  
So far, I&#8217;ve fostered and helped bring dogs to events.

**Favorite PAWS Volunteer moment?**
  
My favorite moment has to be when we were on our way to an event in Connecticut&#8230;we had Reggie, another foster Sophie, as well as 2 fosters from Reading&#8230;we stopped at a rest-stop with a caged in area for dogs, and let all 4 of them roam the area. We were then joined by another owner and his 2 dogs, and they all ran around and played. It was the cutest thing to see them being, well, dogs! Here you have these 4 &#8216;misfit&#8217; dogs that were returned by their families or not taken care of&#8230;and there they were, having the time of their lives, well behaved and galloping around at a rest-stop. It was the littlest thing but I remember it so clear! ðŸ™‚
