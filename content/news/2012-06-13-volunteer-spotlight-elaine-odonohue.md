**Profession:** Histologist

**Current pets:** Sophie, 6yo schnoodle; Maggie May, 7yo terrier mix; Lily, 13yo cat; Snickers, 3yo Maine Coon (In the pic, Sophie (black) & Maggie)

**How long have you volunteered?** Since Feb 2010
  
How were you introduced to PAWS? Found PAWS on line when searching for a way to help shelter dogs.

**What do you do as a volunteer?** I started by checking references on applications. Now I foster, do my own applications and do home visits for other adoption coordinators.

My favorite volunteer moment was when I saw my dogs looking into the dining room with clearly puzzled expressions because my foster, Brandon, was standing in the middle of the dining room table. I also love picking up the dogs at transport.
