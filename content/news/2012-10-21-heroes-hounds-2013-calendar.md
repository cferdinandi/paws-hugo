PAWS is excited to announce the release of our first ever [&#8220;Heroes and Hounds&#8221; calendar](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=EV4JG7ELKFRVN), featuring PAWS New England&#8217;s dogs and the firefighters in Beverly, MA. Photographed by [Jenn Frankavitz Photography](http://www.jennfrankavitz.com/), this calendar features numerous fire fighters and rescue dogs all posing to benefit PAWS New England.

Each 2013 12-month calendar is just $25, including shipping, and 100% of the proceeds will go to dogs in need with PAWS New England.

We want to extend our heartfelt thank you to the Beverly, MA Fire Department for their cooperation in this project!
