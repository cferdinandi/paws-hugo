December is both the best and worst month for volunteers at PAWS New England. On one hand, there is nothing better than seeing many of our dogs spend their first holiday with a loving family. On the other hand, it is especially heartbreaking to see dogs that are left behind in the shelters.

PAWS has participated in Petfinder.com&#8217;s &#8220;Foster A Lonely Pet for the Holidays&#8221; initiative for the last four years. This campaign includes over 13,000 pet rescue organizations across the country, all working to empty their kennels for Christmas.
