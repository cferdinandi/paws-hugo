**Profession:** I am an Install Sales Coordinator for Lowe&#8217;s Home Improvement.

**Current Pets:** My current pets are Bama Basenji mix, Saban Rodesian Ridge back/ Blood hound mix, Tinkerbell a blue point Himalayan, Parker a 17lb Tabby, and Parker my black kitty I kept from a litter of 3 week old kittens that I fostered ðŸ™‚

**How were you introduced to PAWS?** I was introduced to Paws when I was networking some babies from the Tipton Animal Shelter, and seen a plea for the sweetest Pittie girl ever!! They were getting ready to put her to sleep because she was emaciated, covered in fleas and ticks so bad she was very anemic, terrible skin infection, and was heartworm+. I put in the post that I would go and get her, they sent me a foster form and three hours later she was at my house getting a bath, her belly fed, and was covered in blankets.

**What do you do as a volunteer?** What I do as a volunteer for Paws is foster here in Tn. I get them good and healthy so they are ready to go to their forever homes ðŸ™‚

**Favorite Volunteer Moment:** My favorite volunteer moment was watching Sweet Caroline go from death&#8217;s door to a sweet loving healthy angel that she always wanted to be!! She just wanted to be loved and to know she was safe. She was thrown out of a moving truck still in her kennel, and still trusted and loved!!! I think she taught me more than I could ever teach her!!
