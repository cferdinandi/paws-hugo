**Profession:** Caregiver to the Elderly

**Current Pets:** All Rescued&#8230;&#8230;Newman my 13 year old Cocker Spaniel puppy man, Mac my 5 year old Half English/Half French Bulldog who really welcomes the dogs and plays with them all, Molly my 3 year old Shih-Tzu (Paws NE pup) that my husband absolutely fell in love with, Rachel my 18 year old lady cat who doesn&#8217;t realize how old she is and Phoebe my 11 year old cat that hides from everyone.

**How long have you been a volunteer?** I submitted my application to foster with PAWS NE in February of 2012.

**How were you introduced to PAWS?** I started to learn about PAWS NE on Facebook because I have always loved animals and knew I wanted to be involved doing something.
