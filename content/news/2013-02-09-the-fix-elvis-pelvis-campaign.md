We hesitated to take him in as vet bills from other trauma cases have been piling up. However after 48 hours, when no other rescue group came forward, PAWS stepped in. The thought of precious Elvis spending another night at a pound with no access to medical care, was too much.

Elvis was pulled from the pound yesterday and is currently being evaluated at Shelby Center Hospital for Animals in Memphis, TN. Initial xrays indicate two severe breaks on either side of his pelvis requiring $3,500 of orthopedic surgery. The ve[<img class="alignright  wp-image-1578" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" alt="photo(2)" src="https://pawsnewengland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo2-266x300.jpg" width="213" height="240" />](https://pawsnewengland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo2.jpg)ts believe he has the potential to walk again and make a near full recovery because he has retained neurologic function in both legs. Elvis was most likely hit by a car by someone who never even bothered to stop and help üôÅ The volunteers at PAWS will ensure that humanity never lets him down like that again. We will ensure that he has outstanding medical care and receives a never ending supply of TLC.
