[<img class="alignleft  wp-image-1581" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" alt="Valentine_Day_Card_Elvis" src="https://pawsnewengland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Valentine_Day_Card_Elvis-375x300.jpg" width="300" height="240" />](https://pawsnewengland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Valentine_Day_Card_Elvis.jpg)This year, instead of chocolates or flowers, consider giving a special pup the chance to walk again. Elvis is a beagle who was hit by a car and suffered a fractured pelvis. We hope our supporters will read his <a href="https://pawsnewengland.com/the-fix-elvis-pelvis-campaign/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://pawsnewengland.com/the-fix-elvis-pelvis-campaign/">inspiring story</a> below. In honor of Elvis, fellow PAWS pups will be hard at work making Valentine&#8217;s Day Cards (see example to left). These cards will be mailed to PAWS supporters to help raise funds for their buddy Elvis!

You can order personalized Valentine&#8217;s Day Cards by making a $25, $50, $75, or $100 donation to PAWS New England. All donations collected during this campaign will go to the &#8220;Fix Elvis&#8217; Pelvis!&#8221; campaign. Please place all orders by **Monday, Feb 11th at 8am!** _2/11_ _Note: We are now only taking orders to send Valentines to Elvis as he doesn&#8217;t mind if the cards arrive a few days late **ðŸ˜‰**_**
  
** 

Send cards to any dog-loving friend, family member, or your Valentine!
