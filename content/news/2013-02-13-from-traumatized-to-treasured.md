When we first saw this photo of Punky from a month ago, our hearts broke. Punky was the small puppy at Tipton who was so terrified she fell to the ground convulsing during her photo shoot&#8230; She had been found as a stray dog and would wet herself in fear every time someone approached her. The sounds of the shelter were too much for her and poor Punky would spend her days facing the wall&#8230;

When PAWS volunteer Michelle Naifeh saw Punky&#8217;s photo- she did not hesitate. Her only question was, &#8220;What time can I pick her up?&#8221; Michelle got Punky home and immediately realized that this puppy had tremendous potential. She seemed particularly comfortable with Michelle&#8217;s small children. While she was painfully shy, it was evident that this puppy desperately desired to be comfortable around people. She would follow the lead of the other dogs in the house and slowly start to approach different family members &#8220;asking&#8221; for attention.

Soon it was time for Punky to make her big trip North to PAWS Cofounder Kelly Parker&#8217;s house. Kelly was amazed when Punky arrived- she had already made so much progress with Michelle that she was ready to be adopted! Over the next few weeks, different applicants were screen who would be a good fit for Punky. She needed a home that would be patient with her while she continued to regain her confidence- but also be ready to love and appreciate her puppy ways.

When Rachel Rudy emailed about Punky, it was &#8220;love at first email.&#8221; Rachel and her beautiful family lived on nearly 200 acres of land, had two small boys desperate to adopt a dog, and the family had previously owned an under-socialized, shy dog. Rachel and her husband Nat came to meet Punky and the rest was history.

Punky is thriving in her new home! Her new Mom tells us &#8220;She loves her walks and running around the paths around the house and is playing with her toys.
