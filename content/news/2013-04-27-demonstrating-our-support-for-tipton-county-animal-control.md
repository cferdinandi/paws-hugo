Tomorrow, **Sunday April 28th, is the last day** of the Animal Rescue Site Challenge. If you support the changes being made at Tipton County Animal Shelter and would like to see them win a $100,000 prize and feel the support of the entire county, [please go to this link](http://theanimalrescuesite.com/clickToGive/ars/shelter-challenge) and **vote for &#8220;Tipton County Animal Shelter&#8221;** in Brighton, TN. Thank you for your support!

It has been eight months since Anita Shea and Heather Twisdale created [this PAWS and Claws Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PawsandClawsPhotographyTiptonCountyAnimalShelter). The goal of the page was to feature professional photographs of each of the animals at Tipton County Animal Shelter and share them with a national audience to move Tipton towards a &#8220;no kill&#8221; status. In a mere eight months, this massive effort has:

  * Directly led to** <span style="text-decoration: underline;">over</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1,000</span>** dogs and cats being rescued or adopted through rescue outreach, community involvement, and a strong social media presence
  * Forged a relationship with Spay Memphis that has helped alter local animals from low income families to decrease the numbers of pets being bred into overpopulated conditions
  * Created a &#8220;catch, spay, and release&#8221; program for feral cats. Previously all feral cats who came into Tipton were euthanized and now all of them are being spayed/neutered and released
  * Organized a dog-walking program with local volunteers to ensure that all dogs at Tipton are able to get out of their kennels at least once a day
  * Instated a new intake vaccine program that has dramatically decreased the incidence of communicable disease at the shelter and fatalities among puppies and kittens
  * Changed the mindset of a community who once believed that &#8220;there is no way to stop the euthanasia&#8221;

This dramatic change takes courage, unwavering leadership, strong collaborations, and lots of money. Please take a few moments to vote for Tipton County Animal Shelter and be a part of this incredible transformation.
