This week, you have a rare window of opportunity to hold your elected state legislators accountable to animals, and stop the sale of puppy mill dogs in Connecticut.

Rep. Brenda Kupchick has been working very hard this session to make this dream come true. And she can succeed IF enough caring Connecticut residents contact their State House Representatives between now and this Tuesday! 

HB 5027 as amended by Rep. Kupchick, would prohibit CT pet shops from selling commercially bred dogs and cats and instead require that only dogs and cats who are humanely-sourced from animal control facilities and non-profit rescue organizations be sold or adopted out in pet shops.

This measure would help put an end to the suffering of dogs in puppy mills and would reduce pet overpopulation in shelters and the resulting high euthanasia rates.

## How You Can Help

If you&#8217;re a resident of CT, here&#8217;s what you need to do:

  1. Look up your Representative and their contact information here: <http://cga.ct.gov/asp/menu/CGAFindLeg.asp>.
  2. Calls are best (you will always speak with an aide), but emails are fine, too. You only need to ask them to &#8220;support Rep. Kupchick
