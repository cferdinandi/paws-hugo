This event happens twice a year and is only possible thanks to the generosity of our wonderful sponsors: <a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=9bc940933c&e=9c57da83ff" target="_blank">Linda Robinson Dental</a>, The Deirdre Dickinson Memorial Fund, <a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=07c2844cc4&e=9c57da83ff" target="_blank">Wellness Natural Pet Food</a>, and an anonymous donor! PAWS depends on this biannual campaign to keep our organization running.

This year, all donations matched during this period will be used to support the <a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=d54ec9df95&e=9c57da83ff" target="_blank">Owen Fund</a>. Please mark your calendars and check your email for reminders- this is an incredible opportunity to double your impact and help an amazing cause! A $25 donation becomes $50, $50 becomes $100, $500 becomes $1,000!!! Imagine the possibilities for dogs, like Owen, who are in desperate need of extra resources&#8230;

**To allow for mail transit time, all checks received before August 30th will be counted towards the Matching Campaign.**
