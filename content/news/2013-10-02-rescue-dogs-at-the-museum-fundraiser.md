## &#8220;Rescue Dogs at the Museum&#8221;

<span>After the success of ‚ÄúA Golden Retriever at the Museum‚Äù and the follow up, ‚ÄúSharing the Love‚Äù which went viral spanning the globe being exposed to over 1 Million people, Tom Mosser and his companion Lucas are back again. The newest creation is entitled ‚ÄúRescue Dogs at the Museum‚Äù. The original image has helped raise tens of thousands of dollars around the world from proceeds at Charity auctions</span>.

<span>Based upon the great experiences created by this series of artwork, Lucas has decided to become a Doggie Philanthropist and continue to help raise both money and awareness for rescue dogs and other animal related causes. Lucas, along with Tom and their publisher, Almart Fine Art have decided to donate $100.00 from the sale of each print for the first 30 days (beginning 9/18)¬†to animal related charities. The goal is to raise $10,000 for charity. The donation will be split among 4 charities which were selected via an online selection process. The Fab Four are PAWS New England, The Animal Rescue League (Pgh.), Adopt A Golden Knoxville, and Live, Love, Rescue &#8211; Cleveland.</span>

<span>The newest painting has Lucas exposing his favorite art to some new friends. All are actual local rescue dogs. </span><span>Lucas is joined by (left to right) Bubba, Puffer, Rosie, Ella, Sophia and Leah. All 6 were rescue dogs including 4 from Pittsburgh&#8217;s Animal Rescue League and Shelter. and all 6 have found their &#8220;forever homes&#8221;. We will again be producing a Fine Art Giclee Limited Edition on watercolor paper. The Edition will be limited to 200 prints. Each piece will be pencil signed and numbered by Tom Mosser and have a special pawthenticity from Lucas. The image size is 30‚Äù x 22.5‚Äù and the paper size is 36‚Äù x 30‚Äù. The price will be $495.00 each unframed plus shipping and tax if applicable.</span>

<span>The artwork that Tom has created continues to be a great source of pride. He has been able to create artwork that has now been seen by millions of people, and made people smile all over the world. At the same time, he has been able to help raise money and awareness for both large and small animal organizations around the globe.</span>
