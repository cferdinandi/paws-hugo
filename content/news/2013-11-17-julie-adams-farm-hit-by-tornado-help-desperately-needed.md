_**Update 12/13:** All of Julie&#8217;s dogs have been placed in foster care. Thanks to everyone for your help!_

_**Update 11/18 at 10:53am:** You can browse dogs in need of foster from [our list of adoptable dogs](https://pawsnewengland.com/our-dogs/). Julie&#8217;s dogs are marked &#8220;JA&#8221;, and newer browsers can filter the list to just show Julie&#8217;s dogs._

The volunteers at PAWS are in disaster mode. A few hours ago, a tornado touched down close to Julie Adam&#8217;s farm in Oran, Missouri. Thankfully Julie is ok, but that is where the good news stops. Some dogs and cats sustained minor injuries, her extensive food supply was blown away, the fence around her property is destroyed, there is no electricity, and Julie is out frantically trying to search for a lost herd of 600 cattle.

PAWS is initiating our emergency evacuation plan to move Julie and all of her animals to New England while we rebuild. In order to make this happen we are in desperate need of help. What we need now is:

  * A property in CT to house Julie and approximately 10 dogs. Please email Kelly Parker if you are able to help at kesalerno@gmail.com
  * Foster homes for the misplaced animals. Please visit our [foster page](https://pawsnewengland.com/foster/) for more information and send an email to Deb Cameron at [[email_antispambot email=&#8217;paws.debra@gmail.com&#8217;]](mailto:[email_antispambot email='paws.debra@gmail.com']) and Diane Gendron at [[email_antispambot email=&#8217;dianegpawsne@aol.com&#8217;]](mailto:[email_antispambot email='dianegpawsne@aol.com'])
  * Donations <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="U9LJJ5Z2R6ZZ2" />to the &#8220;Julie Adams Tornado Relief Fund&#8221;

We will of course bring you updates as soon as they unfold. For those who are not familiar with Julie or the amazing role she plays at PAWS New England we hope you will watch this inspiring segment from the [HBO Documentary &#8220;One Nation Under Dog.&#8221;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRjPnLL8OZc) Julie&#8217;s compassion is legendary. We are so grateful to our supporters for showing her compassion in her time of need.
