A heartfelt and unique gift idea from PAWS New England that any dog lover is sure to love! Who would not want to receive a Christmas card from the [famous PAWS pup Owen](https://pawsnewengland.com/owen-fund/)??

Each card will come from a PAWS dog that will be receiving the donation and include a photo of this lucky pup. What dog lover would not love to have lifesaving vaccinations and medications donated to a pet in their honor? Or perhaps a dog bed and blankets to keep them warm while they are awaiting a forever home?

For a donation of $150, the animal lover in your life can look at a picture of a dog whose life was saved in honor of them. We hope you will participate in this very special event. **To ensure holiday delivery, please order before December 13th.**
