December is both the best and worst month for volunteers at PAWS New England. On one hand, there is nothing better than seeing many of our dogs spend their first holiday with a loving family. On the other hand, it is especially heartbreaking to see dogs that are left behind in the shelters.

PAWS has participated in Petfinder.com’s “Foster A Lonely Pet for the Holidays” initiative for the last five years. This campaign includes over 13,000 pet rescue organizations across the country, all working to empty their kennels for Christmas.This coordinated effort encourages members of the public to invite a pet home for the holidays. Each year, the program has been increasingly successful.
