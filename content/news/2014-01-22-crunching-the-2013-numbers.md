2013, A Remarkable Year&#8230;.

<img class=" wp-image-1747  alignleft" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" alt="Owen After..." src="https://pawsnewengland.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Snuggles-640x480.jpg" width="358" height="269" />

2013 shattered records on all fronts for PAWS New England! Thanks to an outpouring of support from people like you, PAWS was able to increase our adoptions by **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">thirty percent</span>** from last year! Additionally, PAWS was able to commit to a substantially higher number of special needs dogs from abuse and neglect cases. 2013 saw the advent of the &#8220;<a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=b0fda5b3a6&e=32134a3c9c" target="_blank">Owen Fund</a>,&#8221; a fund specifically designed to offset the staggering medical costs associated with rescuing dogs victimized by trauma who suffer from an array of medical issues. 2013 also saw great tragedy with the <a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=02555ddb5e&e=32134a3c9c" target="_blank">tornado that destroyed the PAWS Sanctuary</a> in Missouri where Julie Adams lives. Your support has helped us start to rebuild as well as explore opportunities in New England to begin a PAWS New England Northern Sanctuary. Here&#8217;s a few summary statistics from the year.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>During 2013:</strong></span>

**653** dogs found their loving forever home through our organization (a **30%** increase from 2012!)

**786** lives were saved from high kill shelters (**a 20%** increase from 2012!)

We spayed/neutered **639** dogs. <a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=518a9fe7dd&e=32134a3c9c" target="_blank">SpayUSA</a> estimates that this has prevented **21,406,500** unwanted animals from being born over the next six years.

**8,247** new facebook users joined the <a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=666898467e&e=32134a3c9c" target="_blank">PAWS New England page</a>. **1,422** new people <a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=502b43731d&e=32134a3c9c" target="_blank">subscribed to our newsletter</a>.

**1,367** people made **2,437** <a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=d42720c04f&e=32134a3c9c" target="_blank">donations</a>. **56 donors** are now committed monthly donors making an average donation of **$30 per month.**

Perhaps the most stunning numbers are those that are coming out of Tipton County Animal Control (TCAS). Since the creation of the <a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=8efbcbc1e6&e=32134a3c9c" target="_blank">Paws and Claws Facebook page</a>, there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of dogs euthanized in the shelter. This is thanks to a close collaboration between exceptional volunteers, multiple rescue groups, and staff at Tipton County in addition to your generous donations. PAWS New England is proud to be part of this remarkable change and we will continue to work until a &#8220;no-kill&#8221; shelter stands in the place of a shelter that started with an 85% euthanasia rate. In 2014, we believe the sky is the limit. Please &#8220;like&#8221; the <a href="http://pawsnewengland.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0c705fc71db1e2d4d6f5f4ba3&id=f92236a2dc&e=32134a3c9c" target="_blank">PAWS and Claws Facebook page</a> and witness this remarkable achievement.
