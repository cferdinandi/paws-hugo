## About The Doggie Investigation Gang

The Doggie Investigation Gang (DIG) is no ordinary business. For starters, it is run completely by three dogs who happen to be best friends and partners for their own detective dog agency. 

Cooper is a big yellow labrador, smart, and always ready for adventure. Charlie is a medium sized spaniel, who&#8217;s a bit of a worrier and always aware of his surroundings. Pedro is a little blind min pin with a fast smelling nose.

Join DIG as they solve their first mystery: The Case of the Missing Canine.
