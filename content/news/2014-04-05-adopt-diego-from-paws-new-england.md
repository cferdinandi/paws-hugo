      Diego is a precious 1 year old lab/pit mix who weighs approximately 50lbs. As you can see from the video, Diego is an absolute LOVE! His favorite activities include playing, cuddling, and hiking with his friends. PAWS New England would like to send a huge thank you to the amazing Elly Rivera at Porkchop&#8217;s Way who has been fostering Diego and allowing him to stay at daycare and go hiking every day! (<a href="http://www.porkchopsway.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">porkchopsway.com/</a>).

      Diego loves, loves, loves other dogs and children. While he things kitties are very fun to play with, some kitties do not appreciate his &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kiss you and love you and lick you and hug you&#8221; way of demonstrating his affection ðŸ™‚ He would do best in an active home or a home that will let him keep going to daycare!
