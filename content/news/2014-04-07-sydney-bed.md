<img class="alignleft  wp-image-1831" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" alt="Sydney" src="https://pawsnewengland.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Sydney-469x640.jpg" width="281" height="384" />Sydney came to PAWS New England after suffering a lifetime of abuse and neglect at the hands of a dog fighting ring. PAWS volunteers rescued her after she was found wandering the streets, barely alive. Sydney spent the last four months of her life living with Porkchop&#8217;s Way owners Elly Rivera and Stephan Shin. Porkchop&#8217;s Way has been instrumental in fostering and training nearly one hundred PAWS dogs. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=669811329754617&set=a.284320301637057.70524.106570126078743&type=1&theater" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=669811329754617&set=a.284320301637057.70524.106570126078743&type=1&theater">Sydney passed away</a>, in Elly&#8217;s arms, as a treasured member of a family after living out the four best months of her entire life. Her passing inspired Elly and Stephan to create a one of a kind Porkchop&#8217;s Bed in her honor. All proceeds from this bed will go directly to PAWS New England. We are so touched by this beautiful gesture.

We also hope that anyone looking for a high-quality, water and accident resistant, comfy dog bed will consider purchasing one of these beds. Our long time supporters will notice that all of the collections are named after PAWS dogs. A portion of all sales will go towards PAWS New England.
