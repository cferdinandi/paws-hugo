We are thrilled to report that Dorothy is thriving in her “Auntie Em’s” care, supported by a team of veterinary specialists.

In fact, Dorothy feels so much better, that she asked us if she could do something to celebrate the incredible compassion and care she received. With Mother’s Day approaching, we thought this would be a perfect way to honor the spirit of empathy and love that defines motherhood.

If you would like to make a donation in honor of a special lady in your life, Dorothy will send a card commemorating your act of generosity (minimum donation of $25). Simply click the button below, and let us know the name of your recipient and the address you would like the card sent to.  All orders must be place by **Tuesday, May 6th before midnight** so we have time to get the cards in the mail to arrive for Mother’s Day! If you have any questions or need to give further instruction, please email Kelly Parker at kesalerno@gmail.com.

And please remember the special canine Moms out there that give so much! If you have a PAWS New England foster Mom that you would like make a donation in honor of, email Kelly Parker and we will ensure that the card arrives to the correct address!

Thank you for your support!

Dorothy, and the Pups and Volunteers at PAWS New England
