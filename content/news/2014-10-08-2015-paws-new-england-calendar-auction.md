We have the perfect opportunity for you to capture your dog and help out a great cause! Paws New England is putting together a “Heroes of Paws New England” calendar! Of course, the biggest heroes among us are our supporters. We are auctioning off each month in the calendar to our fans, including the cover!

The winner of each month will win a 30-45 minute photo shoot with a professional canine photographer in New England, their photo featured in one month of the calendar and a free copy of the Heroes of Paws New England calendar! Bidding for the individual months start at $50 and $100 for the cover.

Bid in our exclusive CALENDAR AUCTION from <span data-term="goog_720977850">October 6 to October 13</span>! To bid, please email Ali at <pawsne.ali@gmail.com> with the month you are bidding on and the bid amount, or visit our auction group on facebook at <https://www.facebook.com/groups/228433033992250/> (Request to add yourself to the group and you’ll be able to comment directly on the photos!)
