We are sure many of our fans braved the crowds and went shopping on _Black <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1086524612"><span class="aQJ">Friday</span></span>_. Many of you will likely fire up your computers to search for deals on _Cy__ber <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1086524613"><span class="aQJ">Monday</span></span>_. Have you ever wondered why we have two days for getting deals and no days for giving back? Well, nonprofits around the world are joining together to celebrate #GivingTuesday. On **<span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1086524614"><span class="aQJ">Tuesday, December 2, 2014</span></span>**, charities, families, businesses, community centers, and students around the world will come together for one common purpose: to celebrate generosity and to give.

Penny Lane announces her #GivingTuesday &#8220;Love is all you need&#8221; campaign

As you can see <a href="https://vimeo.com/102758944?mc_cid=9395a93863&mc_eid=[UNIQID]" target="_blank">in this video</a>, Penny Lane has been given a lot this year. She has been given life, love, and health. So Penny has been anxious to give back and help her friends that are still in the shelter. #GivingTuesday will be Penny&#8217;s chance to turn her stardom into life-saving funds for dogs still in need.

We hope you will enjoy her award-winning performance and heed her call to action.

For $25, you can purchase one of Penny&#8217;s holiday cards. Give the card as a gift or keep it for yourself. It is the perfect way for any dog lover to celebrate the holidays and bring awareness to shelter dogs in need. Penny&#8217;s goal is to sell 500 cards before <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1086524615"><span class="aQJ">midnight</span></span> on #GivingTuesday (<span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1086524616"><span class="aQJ">Tuesday, December 2nd</span></span>). The cards are available <a href="http://www.pawsnewengland.com?mc_cid=9395a93863&mc_eid=[UNIQID]" target="_blank">now by clicking this link</a>. Follow <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PAWSNewEngland?mc_cid=9395a93863&mc_eid=[UNIQID]" target="_blank">PAWS New England on facebook </a>this #GivingTuesday as we broadcast the number of cards sold every four hours starting at <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1086524617"><span class="aQJ">8am</span></span>. This is one of the most ambitious goals we have ever set, but Penny Lane has been taught to dream big. Help us reach this goal and remind the world that &#8220;Love is all you need.&#8221;

Thank you and Happy #Giving <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1086524618"><span class="aQJ">Tuesday</span></span>!
