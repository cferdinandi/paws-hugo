Shara is a long time volunteer, foster, and adoptive Mom for PAWS New England and one of the most talented and compassionate ladies we know! As Shara was deciding the best way she could support rescue, she decided to merge her talents as a writer with her passion for homeless dogs. And the Doggie Investigation Gang was born! The second book of t<span class="text_exposed_show">he series is now out, and we are hoping that our supporters will show editors and publishers that children&#8217;s books about dog rescue are beloved and worthwhile projects! </span>

    The Case of the Missing Pendant
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    The Doggie Investigation Gang, DIGâ„¢ was the talk of Pawtown! Since they solved their first mystery, The Case of the Missing Canine (ISBN 978-0-9776396-5-6), the news about their skills and teamwork had spread quickly among all the dogs at Bow Wow Park. The dogs could not believe how fast the Doggie Investigation Gang found Gizmo&#8217;s missing canine friend, Duchess. The Doggie Investigation Gang is run completely by three dogs that happen to be best friends and partners of their own detective agency. Cooper is a big yellow labrador, clever and loves a mystery. Charlie is a medium-sized spaniel that is a bit of a worrier and never late for appointments.

    Pedro is a small, blind min pin that has mastered his sense of smell. Together, and with the help of their friends they solve mysteries in an effort to assist others. The intended audience for this series is second to fourth grade students. While being introduced to third-grade level vocabulary, speaker dialogue and chapter books they will learn hidden lessons such as conflict resolution, the value of individual strengths and differences and the importance of teamwork. A portion of the sales of this book will be donated to PAWS New England to assist in rescuing the dogs residing at Tipton County Animal Shelter, a high-kill shelter located in Tipton, TN.
