PAWS New England has the most dedicated volunteers on the planet! In fact, volunteer Maureen Gillespie is so committed to the mission of saving dogs in high kill shelters that she is going to endure a grueling 26.2 mile marathon to help raise money for the dogs at PAWS New England. She recorded this video message to tell you more about her inspiring mission:

Our goal is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>recruit 500 teammates</strong></span> to the PAWS New England Team Tennessee Brown Dog. You can become a teammate by **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">donating $26.20</span>** before midnight on **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monday, April 20th</span>**.

Better yet, consider making your $26.20 a recurring monthly donation and help us make miracles happen for dogs like Tulah and Zorro. As a way to say thanks, PAWS will randomly select a new monthly donor to receive 4 Red Sox tickets with a VIP tour of Fenway Park!
