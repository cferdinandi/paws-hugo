**Profession:** 2<sup>nd</sup> Grade Teacher

**Fur Family:** Fenway, Molly, Harley, Wrigley, Ironman, Dempsey (cat), Franklin (tortoise)

**What do you do as a volunteer:** Foster

**How were you introduced to PAWS:** In 2008, I was looking for a community service project for my second grade class to participate in. We helped raise money for a pit bull that needed to have his leg amputated after an accident. Joanne told me I might like fostering, so I tried it and havenâ€™t stopped since.

**Why do you volunteer for PAWS:** I LOVE working with all of our amazing volunteers and seeing the difference that a warm bed and love makes in the life of these dogs.

**Favorite PAWS Moment:** Fostering Hope and participating in the One Nation Under Dog HBO documentary.
