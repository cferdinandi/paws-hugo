  <em>Are you looking for the perfect Mother’s Day Gift for that special rescue Mom? Look no further- this Mother’s Day, recognize that special Mom in your life by making a donation in honor of Mama dogs rescued by Paws New England!</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
  PAWS will be paying tribute to all rescue Moms this Mother’s Day with a beautiful Mother’s Day Card. Each card will include a photo of a former Mama dog rescued by Paws New England. For $25, what dog-loving Mom would not love to have lifesaving vaccinations and medications donated to a pet in their honor? Or perhaps a dog bed and blankets to keep them warm while they are awaiting a forever home for $50? And, for a donation of $150, what Mother would not love to look at a picture of a dog whose life was saved in her honor, with the name of her choosing! We hope you will participate in this very special event.
