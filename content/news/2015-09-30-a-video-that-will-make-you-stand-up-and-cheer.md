## <span class="title">The Matching Campaign is Here!</span>

Our annual pledge campaign has officially launched. Extraordinary donor Marium Holland has challenged the PAWS New England volunteers to raise $5,000 in monthly donations between September 30th &#8211; October 3rd. Monthly donations are the lifeblood of this organization and allow us to continue our operations during times of the year when donations are low.

It has never been so easy to become a monthly donor with PAWS New England:

  * Text &#8220;Paws&#8221; to 71777
  * Make a <a href="https://pawsnewengland.com/donate/#monthly" target="_blank">monthly donation here</a>

Why should you donate to PAWS New England? We invite you to turn up the volume on your computer, <a href="https://vimeo.com/138462912" target="_blank">watch this video</a>, and enjoy being part of something extraordinary.
  

  
Tune in from September 30th &#8211; October 3rd to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PAWSNewEngland" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/pawsnewengland/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/PAWSNewEngland" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to follow our progress towards our goal. During each day of the campaign, we will release an inspiring video that highlights the work of our organization. Don&#8217;t miss these feel-good movies and an opportunity to be part of this incredible event.

As always, we are humbled by your support and will continue to make you proud with our great work!

Many thanks,
  
The Pups and Volunteers at PAWS New England
