On Friday December 18th, the biggest rescue in the history of PAWS New England will begin.

Forty-five dogs coming from the most heart-wrenching beginnings are about to have their lives transformed. PAWS New England Cofounders &#8220;Starbucks Lady&#8221; and &#8220;Diet Pepsi Queen&#8221; will work with the extraordinary pilots at [Cloud Nine Rescue Flights](http://www.cloudninerescueflights.org/) to load 45 of these courageous canines onto a charter plane bound for New England.

In Rhode Island, the pups will be met by volunteers from PAWS New England, [Westerly Animal Shelter](https://www.facebook.com/Westerly-Animal-Shelter-1445262885761206/), [Blue Dog Shelter](https://www.facebook.com/bluedogshelter/) and the [Animal Protection Center of Southeastern Massachusetts](https://www.facebook.com/APCSM/) who will partner together to find them loving homes. This partnership gives homeless puppies in Tennessee and Texas a chance at a new life. It offers our partner shelters in New England a chance to adopt out crowd-drawing puppies and increase foot traffic to the shelter. And it offers New England citizens a chance to rescue the puppy of their dreams. You can help homeless animals, local shelters, and the great people of New England by becoming part of this project.

Our goal is to raise $3,000 in monthly donations before the plane touches down in New England. If we are successful, we can fund this trip every single month. A one time donation will help save the lives of these 45 dogs, but a monthly donation will give life to hundreds of future homeless dogs in need. Join us today in creating a miracle for these special animals!

Weâ€™re staffed entirely by volunteers. We have no paid employees and minimal overhead costs. Because of this, 99-cents of every dollar we receive goes directly towards helping our dogs.
