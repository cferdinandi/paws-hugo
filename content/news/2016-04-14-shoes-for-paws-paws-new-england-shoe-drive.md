Paws New England is now conducting a shoe collection drive through May 15, 2016. PAWS NE will earn funds based on the number of pairs collected as Funds2Orgs will purchase all of the donated goods.  Those dollars will directly benefit the rescue work and also support micro-enterprises in developing countries. An additional benefit of this drive is to reduce the amount of discarded shoes into the local landfills!

  <span style="color: black">PAWS NE is an all-volunteer effort and 99.9 cents of every dollar it raises raise goes to the dogs in its care. Because a good many of its dogs arrive sick or injured volunteers conduct fundraising activities year round. PAWS is excited to be partnering up with Funds2Orgs to raise funds for the many needy dogs from puppies to seniors, who end up in its care.</span>

      All donated shoes will then be redistributed throughout the Funds2Orgs network of microenterprise partners. Funds2Orgs helps impoverished people start, maintain and grow businesses in countries such as Haiti, Honduras and other nations in Central America and Africa. Proceeds from the shoe sales are used to feed, clothe and house their families. One budding entrepreneur in Haiti even earned enough to send to her son to law school!

      “We are excited about our shoe drive,&#8221; said Ali Norton, PAWS Volunteer. &#8220;We know that most people have extra shoes in their closets they could donate to great organizations which help those less fortunate become self-sufficient, save the lives of dogs and help the environment at the same time!  It’s a win-win for everyone!”
