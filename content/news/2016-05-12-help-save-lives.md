**Join Team PAWS!**

Join us this Saturday, 5/14, at [Seven Arrows Farm](http://www.sevenarrowsfarm.com) in Seekonk, MA, to learn more about volunteering with PAWS New England. Since the inception of our organization in 2008, we have saved over 8,000 lives!! None of this would have been possible without the generosity of volunteers, fosters and donors.
