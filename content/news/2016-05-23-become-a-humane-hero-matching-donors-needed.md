Twice a year, PAWS New England launches a Matching Campaign fundraiser. Partner corporations, local business, and private donors are recruited to partner with PAWS and pledge the funds needed to ensure the success of this vital campaign. These donors generously pledge between $1,000-$10,000 and challenge PAWS New England supporters to match those funds over a 3-4 day period at the end of July 18-21, 2016. _The double impact of donations inspires our greatest level of giving during the year and is directly responsible for saving hundreds of lives._

This year, we will be aptly naming our matching sponsors &#8220;Humane Heroes.&#8221; Heroes will be recognized for their extraordinary generosity on our website, in PAWS social media sites that reach over 55,000 supporters, in email blasts that reach almost 7,500 supporters, and in any local press coverage.Â  Sponsors will also awarded with a personalized plague to recognize their life-saving contribution to homeless animals.
