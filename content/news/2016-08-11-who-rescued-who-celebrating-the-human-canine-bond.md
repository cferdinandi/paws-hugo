  <a href="https://pawsnewengland.com">PAWS New England</a> recognizes the unique and emotional bond between human and dog. We are lucky enough to share this world with these amazing beings; grateful for all of the love & joy they bring to our lives.
</p>

  In honor of these incredible relationships, this year we celebrate the bond between YOU and your canine best friend! For those who have never experienced it, this special bond can some times be indescribable. Luckily, a <span class="text_exposed_show">photograph can express the emotions that 1000 words cannot!</span>
