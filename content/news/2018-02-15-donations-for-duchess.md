PAWS New England first learned about Duchess last week when rescue colleagues reached out to us for help.

A 12lb yorkie/poodle mix had been hit by a car and had devastating fractures to both of her back legs. Surgical and treatment costs would exceed $7,000 and the rescue facility could not afford that level of care.

But volunteers instantly fell in love and could not imagine having to euthanize a dog who was only two years old with a treatable injury.

PAWS struggled with what to do.

Our organization was juggling several critical cases and was wracking up veterinary bills at a dizzying pace. Ultimately, we could not say no to Duchess&#8217; soulful eyes.

We decided to transfer her to our incredible partners at Memphis Veterinary Specialists where Duchess underwent several hours of orthopedic surgery.

Duchess underwent three rounds of surgery to facilitate all of the orthopedic repairs that she needed. Her surgeries went smoothly and we all thought that Duchess was on the road to what would be a long, but successful recovery.

This morning we learned the devastating news that Duchess has been diagnosed with parvovirus and had to be transferred to the ICU for lifesaving care. What an unbearably unfair course of events for this precious girl who has already endured so much.

PAWS remains unwavering in our commitment to Duchess, but we are in need of your help. Please consider making a donation towards Duchess&#8217; staggering veterinary bills.

Help give us the resources to continue her life-saving care and give this small girl with a big spirit the chance to live a long and happy life where she will be cherished by an adoptive family.

We will continue to update everyone on her progress, thank you for your support!
