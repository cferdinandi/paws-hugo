It has been a busy winter so far this year, but what is now unfolding is the true meaning of what our group does.

![](/img/articles/winter-cold-1.png)**Record breaking cold** is sweeping the country, and while you might be reading on the news how many customers are without power, what you aren’t seeing in the news is **the faces of the dogs who live outside in this cold**. Some have homes where they remain chained outside - with a crate, perhaps with a tarp to shield the wind. Others are strays who may miss the touch of human’s hands scratching their ears, but may also be lucky in their ability to hide under a warm house.

Our southern volunteers are teaming up with All 4s Rescue League who have been going around Memphis trying to help where they can - with tarps, straw or dog food. We’ve asked our volunteers to round up as many dogs as they can and get them to the safety of a boarding facility.

We have pulled 40 so far and can't wait to share their rescue stories with you. Follow our progress on our facebook page: www.facebook.com/PawsNewEngland
