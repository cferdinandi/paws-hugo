Stevie is a sweet-as-pie, 9-month rescue straight off the island of Aruba! We believe this cutie is a Whippet\/Hound mix. Gosh is it a cute combo, wouldn't you say?\n\nTrust us when we tell you how surprised Stevie was after leaving sunshiny Aruba to land here in New England just in time for the first snow fall. After a few frolics in the snow, we are pretty sure Stevie is okay with the, eh, colder conditions. Especially when he has a jacket on and playmate in the yard... The prospect of a new, loving forever home is worth all the snow in the world to this guy! Could that forever home be with you?\n\nAs Stevie was a stray in Aruba, he is a bit on the shy side. Living with humans is new to him. However, like the snow, it's a new thing that he is finding he absolutely adores. Once he is given a moment to get grounded, this little guy wants nothing more than to be loved by people. He loves getting neck and belly rubs and giving his people kisses to let them know he loves and appreciates them. \n\nStevie could be described as medium energy. When he is in the house, he is quite calm. He's content to lay down with a bone or play quietly with a tennis ball. However, he does have some playful energy about him. We've found that he really likes to get outdoors and adventure. Do you have a nice fenced in area for him to run? Do you like long walks? Maybe a weekend hike? Wow, Stevie is THRILLED at the prospect of all of the above. He would be so happy to have a human (or a family of humans) to go adventuring with!\n\nWe've found that Stevie really thrives when he is around other dogs. We do think he could be an only dog. However, he seems happiest when he has a buddy around to play with! He also gets a little confidence from other dogs. For instance, he is working on his leash walking outside. When we go on walks alone, he seems a little unsure. When we go on walks with his foster brothers, he is ALL in! Sniffing and exploring the neighborhood like a pro! \n\nWe so hope you will consider adopting Stevie. We feel strongly that this sweet soul is sure to bring abundant happiness into your life! \n\n \n\nName: Stevie Ruba\nBreed:  Whippet\/Hound mix\nSex: Male\nAge: 9 months\nWeight: 32 lbs\nSpayed\/Neutered:   Neutered\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Too young to test.\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS: \nGood with Children: Yes\nGood with Dogs: Yes (loves other dogs of all sizes)\nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\nDonation: &#160;$500.00 \n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog.

Ginger is fostering in New England! \n\nGinger Spice is one of the litter of the Spice Girls that were born in a lady&#8217;s pasture after their mom (a 15 lb terrier) had been dumped in the country. Luckily the lady found the mom in time to be able to care for her and her babies.  It appears that dad was a chihuahua just based on the puppies&#8217; looks.  She has had a not so ideal beginning, but this is now all behind her. She is a little skiddish, and can be afraid of a hand and would back up. She adapts very quickly and learns to trust, within a day she knew what &#8220;pick up&#8221; means. \n\nShe is submissive, always on the move, loves her toys, even the big ones, and loves to romp around with her foster sibblings. She is not a typical Chihuahua, as she is not high strung or a barker, just a puppy who needs to be trained. Housebreaking is in process, and she walks on the leash, but stays very close to the feet at this time.  The ideal home would be one with lots of love and attention. She seems to be used to table food, and jumps on your lap to get to the human food.  \n\nGinger Spice needs to regain her girly puppy figure with some high quality nutrition and exercise. While she does not go in her crate voluntarily, once she is in, she is all good and she settles in. She will be an awesome little dog with time and patience to train to good house manners. Because of her tiny size, a home with no young children would be best, but she would love another doggie friend to play with.\n\nName: Ginger Spice\nSex: Female\nBreed: Chihuahua\/small terrier mix\nAge: Date of birth 5\/4\/18\nWeight: 9 pounds on 11\/8\/18\nSpayed\/Neutered: Will be spayed before adoption.\nVaccinations: Up to date in the puppy series.

She is now in an amazing foster home and is starting to blossom. \n\nCoral loves dog toys (balls & tug ropes especially), children (all ages), walks and SNUGGLING!  She loves belly rubs and attention from her humans, but is not &#8220;needy&#8221; or &#8220;clingy.&#8221;  She is content to entertain herself and is just as content to take a long nap on the couch with whomever she can round up!\n\nShe loves people and NEVER meets a stranger.

Dogs, children, adults, cats &#8211; she loves them all!\n\nWe think that Coral might have a slight case of &#8220;body dysmorphia&#8221; (JUST JOKING!) because she thinks she&#8217;s a lap dog!

She can twist herself into a tight little ball and make herself look so small.\n\nCoral would be so happy in a forever home with an active family (she&#8217;s very agile and loves to walk and run).  She needs a fenced back yard (or a fenced area) to exercise and use the bathroom.  She would also thrive in a home where children live because she is crazy about children and is very sweet and gentle with them.

Not a busy home - quiet - fenced yard where he can be outside. Leash walking - he's a pro - he can be a little reactive when strangers approach but is easily managed and is getting better.   \n\nHe's fostering now with other dogs - at first I wasn't sure he could live with another dog but i'm starting to think he would actually enjoy it - there's a few here that he actually plays with and one that he constantly hangs out with; he's not a fan of big dogs however.\n\nHelp us find a good situation for this boy - he looks at you like he loves you so much even though you just met him - he is a super cuddler with his human (even this new human he barely knows).

Haylie is the dog for you! \n\nHaylie is calm, quiet, well behaved, has soulful eyes and an easy going personality.

Haylie is guarded about her injury and needs slow introduction to new dogs.

Foster mom named him Gandhi because it represents a man of peace, goodness and non-violence, everything that this sweet boy deserves in his life. \n \nGandhi was found walking in circles in a hay field in the rural south.  Our local foster mom was told of him and she went to investigate. She found a young dog who was covered in scars to his body, face and eyes, most likely from a pellet gun.  It appeared that he was blind. He was immediately taken to the vet, where her her worse thoughts were confirmed.  He was covered in pellet wounds, including in both eyes. \n \nAfter an initial few days of rest, Gandhi had surgery to remove his left eye (the worse of the two) and to be neutered, which was seemingly already attempted in a most barbaric way.\nHe initially recovered in his southern foster home and now is local in New England.\n\nFOSTER UPDATE 11\/8\/18:\n\nDon't ask Gandhi about being blind, not sure he knows he is!  His zest for life is infectious (OK a couple of the senior dogs he's fostering with call it annoying ...) but he is the happiest dog ever.  He loves every person he meets and jumps up with an enthusiastic greeting to ensure you don't ignore him (working on that!).  He also loves every dog he meets, and can't understand why they wouldn't want to run, wrestle and play endlessly.  He's been in his new foster home for two weeks now, and has pretty much mastered the layout so the head-bumps are much less frequent.  \n\nGandhi loves to roam the house trying to find his people, his toys and the other dogs, but for safety reasons he is currently crated when his people are at work.  He \"kennels up\" when asked to and is becoming more and settled into his routine.  Dependent upon your home situation, this can be adjusted accordingly. \n\nGandhi is house trained, a dream in the car and adores exploring the neighborhood. Such a joy to see this boy in action after such a tragic beginning. \n\nGet your applications in for our very special southern gentleman!

I am officially ready for my forever home. I need a house full of soft beds, people who like snuggles and yummy treats! I LOVE people but am a little nervous when I first meet men. I get along great with all of the dogs and people I have met here. I'm always happy and I love to play...with anything!   I'm really smart too.  I know how to sit and I've just about got this \"going potty\" thing down. I love attention. I could be your one and only or have other fur friends, just no cats because they are too fun to chase. \n\nIf I sound like your kinda guy, please let PAWS NE you are interested and fill out an application!!  \nLove,  \nFlounder\n\n\nName: Flounder\nSex: Male\nBreed: Papillon mix\nAge: 3 years old\nWeight: 9.3 pounds as of 6\/26\nSpayed\/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date \nHeartworm:  Negative\nMicrochipped: Will be before adoption\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nDogs: Yes\nCats: No\nKids: Yes, older children only\n\n\n\nAdoption Donation: 450.00\n\n\n&#160;\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog.

She was a very patient, caring, amazing mom!   Her puppies    have all been adopted and traveled north and now it's Mona's turn.   \n\nEverything seems new to Mona.  She is happy to have a small space to call her own and takes good care of her bedding and toys.  \n\nShe has done well with every dog in her foster home.  She enjoys their company, and occasionally gives them kisses.  She loves toys and routinely selects new ones from the toy basket and takes them to her secret place.  She doesn't actually play with the toys but likes having them around.  When outside Mona likes to sit in the shade and watch what the other dogs are doing and observe the happenings in the yard.  \n\nMona is housebroken with a doggy door but is afraid to go outside during heavy rains and thunder storms.  She is still skiddish and shows signs that she may have been abused by running to her safe place if she hears loud noises or if a person has anything in their hands.   We are working on Mona's confidence and making progress.  She is no longer afraid of a leash and gets excited when it's time for her walk - especially if another dog is going walking with her.   \n\nMona is calm and well behaved but gets overly excited around cats. She is gentle when taking treats and loves affection.  She is still nervous when being held and is sometimes afraid to approach people.  \n\nMona would do best in a quiet home with another dog for her to bond with. Until she gains more confidence she should wear a harness while walking as she occasionally panics when hearing unfamiliar noises. \n\nCheck out her video! https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=10211816115827976&id=1522178203\n\n\nName:  Mona\nSex:  Female\nBreed:  Shepherd\/Terrier mix \nAge:  5 years old\nWeight:  34 pounds \nSpayed:  Yes\nVaccinations:  Up to date\nHeartworm:  Negative\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with dogs:  Yes.

This guy is a gorgeous (even more so in person) pittie with a gorgeous face and a lovely personality that will suck you right in! And, if you have a good throwing arm and like to have the ball returned promptly and repeat, today's your day to learn about your next best friend.\n\nKodiak (Kodi to his friends and family) had a tough beginning to his life but we aren't dwelling on that - what you need to know is that the last three years of his life have been full of love and hard work with his adoptive parents. They took this boy as a foster when we couldn't get anyone else to do it; they not only took him in, they worked with him non-stop to turn him into the happy, confident boy he is today.\n\nKodi would just as soon sit in your back yard while you toss a ball to him than do anything else - he LOVES his humans and is happy to be involved in anything they are involved in. And once he gets to know your friends, he will love them too.\n\nAnd now the part that is tough - as happy and adjusted as he is, Kodi is a guarder of his \"things\" - what's his is his and what is another dog's is his -it's called resource guarding and this includes any toys, treats, balls (especially) and this also includes his people - he wants them all to himself and thus Kodi must be an only dog to truly be able to relax and enjoy life. His family has managed him with another dog in the home but they have mastered this and we aren't sure someone else will want too - so let's just have him be your only dog and it's a no-brainer!!!\n\nHis family has visitors to the house all the time, - big humans and smaller ones - he is 100% fine with them if no other dog is present.\n\nResource guarding can carry a concern when there are young children\/toddlers in the home - and this lovely couple were overjoyed to welcome their baby girl into their lives. She is now crawling and starting to walk and it's evident that Kodi will not be sharing any toys\/treats or anything of his with her either as long as their other dog is in the are. This creates an unsafe environment for a little one as you can't explain to them that Kodi won't share and if you persist, he may not be happy about it.\n\nTo be clear, he has NEVER bit anyone or attempted to bite anyone, especially this baby. And he has played with older children with glee.\n\nThis is because he has two parents who are ever-vigilant and knowledgeable and who have worked hard to prevent any accidents.\n\nKodi's parents have come to a very hard decision - in order for their little one to be completely safe and for Kodi to remain safe as well and make their other dog happy, it's time to find a new home for him - one in which he won't be separated from his humans because of a mini-human - a home where he can roam freely without the worry of someone trying to take his things.\n\nThe ideal home we want for Kodi? \n~ Adults only without chaos (teens ok) \n~ Large fenced yard where he can play by himself which he does quite well with his \"things.\" \n~ No dog parks for this boy - too stressful for him.\n~ Someone with a good throwing arm\n\nThis boy is worth it.\n\nHis current family will be involved in his placement as they adore him (as you can see from the photos); he is their boy but they know that in order for him to be truly happy, he needs his own home, his own space and boundaries when with his new loved ones.\n\nContact for more information: pawsalexandra@gmail.com\n\nName: Kodi (Kodiak)\nBreed: Pit Bull Terrier\nSex: Male\nAge: 5 1\/2 years approx.\nWeight: 66 lbs\nSpayed\/Neutered: Yes\nMicrochipped: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Negative, on preventative","images":3,"video":null},{"id":7637,"name":"Miller","size":"Large","age":"Adult","sex":"Male","breeds":["Labrador Retriever","Terrier"],"nodogs":false,"nocats":true,"nokids":false,"specialneeds":false,"sheltercode":"2018548","description":"Fostered in New England starting 10\/27!\n\nMiller is a curious guy and loves to explore!

Well, it&#8217;s a vibrant, southern flower with some pretty inspiring symbolism! For instance, it symbolizes faithfulness and the coming of Spring. Pretty beautiful sounding, huh? Well, it is quite fitting that this stunning 2-year old pit bull, Camellia. She herself is a faithful southern gal, on a quest for her furever home. Could it be you?\n\nWe firmly believe that Camellia lives up to the beauty of her name. She is extremely loving, well-mannered, and playful. She&#8217;s the kind of gal that can easily be the life of the party but would also prefer being in by 9pm for a quiet night on the couch! We don&#8217;t know about you but that is our kind of girl!\n\nCamellia was rescued by her foster Mom from a high-kill shelter. Her personality was just far too sweet and she wanted to give this gal a second chance at life! Since she&#8217;s been living at home with her foster Mom, Camellia has really come into bloom (pun intended). She lives in playful harmony with the resident canines. And, gosh, is it playful harmony. Camellia LOVES to play with other dogs. She would be thrilled to learn that a family with another dog wanted to adopt her! However, it's not necessary to have another dog in the home. Just a bonus for Camellia!\n\nDid we mention that Camellia has a pretty good amount of energy? What does this mean for you, her potential family, you ask? Well, it means you have a jogging partner extraordinaire. And a dog that will scale a mountain, faithfully by your side! A dog that would love running along the beach or skipping through the local dog park, stopping only occasionally to smell a few flowers and, OF COURSE, play with other dogs! \n\nCamellia is a medium to high energy girl. Smart and eager to please, she will be FUN to train. She&#8217;d be a great partner in agility training or other fun, doggy training.\n\nCamellia truly is an all around great dog. With her stunning good looks and the personality to boot, we sure hope you&#8217;ll consider applying to adopt Camellia.

I am also well behaved. I hardly bark, except to tell you when I need to go do my business outside. I have been working very hard on trusting new people I meet. Something scary happened to me before PAWS rescued me, so when I meet new people it takes me a little while to trust them. I&#8217;ve been going to obedience class to learn how to be more trusting of other people. It&#8217;s very helpful because I trust people a lot more when they have another dog with them, which is why I really need another dog in my new home. My trainer says she is so impressed with how I am always willing to try something new, even when I am afraid! She loves to watch me warm up to new people.
