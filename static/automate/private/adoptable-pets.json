For the past two years they have been very well loved and cared for.  Not long ago, their people had a change of heart and decided to stop hunting.  Instead of selling Levi and Reno to another hunter, they wanted to give them early retirement and a life of indoor leisure and love.  Sadly, their other indoor dogs were unwilling to share the couch, so the owners asked us if we could find a new home for them together.  We said sure! \n\nThese boys are very affectionate, both with each other and with humans.  Reno is generally very social and is a true Velcro dog; he wants to be as close to you as possible, and preferably, closer to you than any of the other dogs.  We&#8217;re working with him on sharing his humans, but this will likely be an ongoing process.  Levi lets Reno take the lead and is a tad bit more cautious when interacting with humans.  He usually arrives a little more slowly and stays within reach, but takes a bit more time to warm up. \n\nThey are currently fostering with 3 other dogs, 1 other beagle and 2 large dogs, and have done fine with them with the proper slow introductions.  They are true beagles and LOVE to follow their noses!

While I am in my garden,&#160;Max&#160;and Lucas would play or just relax in the grass. \n\n~ Maxx also loves the water and swimming.\n~ He does well in car rides and during bath time.&#160;\n~ Max&#160;is also very food motivated.\n\nThings to work on:\n~ Listening a little better; I think he just gets too excited, so a calm, strict voice is key.&#160;\n~ Maxx doesn&#8217;t have boundaries of knowing what is his and what isn&#8217;t but I believe that could be easily reinforced.&#160;\n~ Maxx is definitely a toy hog, he has stolen bones from my dog after been given his own, gladly he is not aggressive about it, we are able to take the bones away with no problem except for his tight grip.&#160;\n~ Maxx plays great with other dogs but sometimes gets a little rough but is easily distracted to calm down.\n~ Maxx is still in the process of being leash trained; using a harness is beneficial for him.&#160;\n\nCATS:&#160; Surprise, surprise!!! Not only is&#160;max&#160;great with other dogs, he also doesn&#8217;t pay much mind to cats, he will acknowledge them. Give them a sniff and be on his way.&#160;\n\nCHILDREN: Yes!!&#160; &#160;Max&#160;also does very well with kids while being attended.&#160;Max&#160;on multiple occasions heard my nephew crying and went right up to him trying to cuddle and give him kisses.&#160;Max&#160;doesn&#8217;t know when too many kisses is enough - maybe not a bad thing?\n\nThe perfect home for&#160;Max&#160;would be a home with another dog, brother or sister that is as playful as him, a family that is active and likes adventures and someone who really has the time and dedication to train him.\n\nIf you are looking for a puppy that is already potty trained and just needs some TLC and lots of love, then&#160;Max&#160;is your boy. He is such a great pup. I will definitely miss&#160;Max&#160;when he finds his forever home.\n\n\"In daycare he really enjoys playing and sometimes need some redirection for playing a little too rough.

She is a very smart girl who is very receptive to training. Her ideal home would be a young, active couple or family.

This guy is a gorgeous (even more so in person) pittie with a gorgeous face and a lovely personality that will suck you right in! And, if you have a good throwing arm and like to have the ball returned promptly and repeat, today's your day to learn about your next best friend.\n\nKodiak (Kodi to his friends and family) had a tough beginning to his life but we aren't dwelling on that - what you need to know is that the last three years of his life have been full of love and hard work with his adoptive parents. They took this boy as a foster when we couldn't get anyone else to do it; they not only took him in, they worked with him non-stop to turn him into the happy, confident boy he is today.\n\nKodi would just as soon sit in your back yard while you toss a ball to him than do anything else - he LOVES his humans and is happy to be involved in anything they are involved in. And once he gets to know your friends, he will love them too.\n\nAnd now the part that is tough - as happy and adjusted as he is, Kodi is a guarder of his \"things\" - what's his is his and what is another dog's is his -it's called resource guarding and this includes any toys, treats, balls (especially) and this also includes his people - he wants them all to himself and thus Kodi must be an only dog to truly be able to relax and enjoy life. His family has managed him with another dog in the home but they have mastered this and we aren't sure someone else will want too - so let's just have him be your only dog and it's a no-brainer!!!\n\nHis family has visitors to the house all the time, - big humans and smaller ones - he is 100% fine with them if no other dog is present.\n\nResource guarding can carry a concern when there are young children\/toddlers in the home - and this lovely couple were overjoyed to welcome their baby girl into their lives. She is now crawling and starting to walk and it's evident that Kodi will not be sharing any toys\/treats or anything of his with her either as long as their other dog is in the are. This creates an unsafe environment for a little one as you can't explain to them that Kodi won't share and if you persist, he may not be happy about it.\n\nTo be clear, he has NEVER bit anyone or attempted to bite anyone, especially this baby. And he has played with older children with glee.\n\nThis is because he has two parents who are ever-vigilant and knowledgeable and who have worked hard to prevent any accidents.\n\nKodi's parents have come to a very hard decision - in order for their little one to be completely safe and for Kodi to remain safe as well and make their other dog happy, it's time to find a new home for him - one in which he won't be separated from his humans because of a mini-human - a home where he can roam freely without the worry of someone trying to take his things.\n\nThe ideal home we want for Kodi? \n~ Adults only without chaos (teens ok) \n~ Large fenced yard where he can play by himself which he does quite well with his \"things.\" \n~ No dog parks for this boy - too stressful for him.\n~ Someone with a good throwing arm\n\nThis boy is worth it.\n\nHis current family will be involved in his placement as they adore him (as you can see from the photos); he is their boy but they know that in order for him to be truly happy, he needs his own home, his own space and boundaries when with his new loved ones.\n\nContact for more information: pawsalexandra@gmail.com\n\nName: Kodi (Kodiak)\nBreed: Pit Bull Terrier\nSex: Male\nAge: 5 1\/2 years approx.\nWeight: 66 lbs\nSpayed\/Neutered: Yes\nMicrochipped: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Negative, on preventative","images":3,"video":null},{"id":7683,"name":"Sally Chaps","size":"Large","age":"Adult","sex":"Female","breeds":["Terrier","Labrador Retriever"],"description":"If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to become Internet-famous, Sally Chaps is your girl!

Whether she&#8217;s playing at the park with pals, practicing tricks with her new owner, hiking the Blue Hills, or romping around at home, she&#8217;s going to be Instagram gold. Just think of the Instastories you could do with her as the star! \n\nAnd if you&#8217;re not into social media fame, Sally is cool with that, too: her ideal home is one that gives her lots of love and includes her in fun things like doggie playdates, runs, and agility class, and cameras are totally optional. Sally isn&#8217;t a diva, and she would do beautifully in a home with kids and with other fun, friendly dogs or as a solo dog who gets play time with other dogs. Sally has the mind of a comedian in the body of a dog model. Now all she needs is a forever home where she can show off her star quality!\n\nCheck out her video here: https:\/\/m.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=10211027892722891&id=1522178203\n\nName:  Sally Chaps\nSex:  Female\nBreed: Unknown\/mix\nAge:  2 years\nWeight:  52 pounds\nSpayed: Yes\nVaccinations:  Up to date\nHeartworm Negative:  Tested on 4\/30\/18\nMIcrochipped:  Yes\n\nGood with dogs:  Yes\nGood with cats:  No\nGood with kids:  Expected to do well based on personality.

Well, it&#8217;s a vibrant, southern flower with some pretty inspiring symbolism! For instance, it symbolizes faithfulness and the coming of Spring. Pretty beautiful sounding, huh? Well, it is quite fitting that this stunning 2-year old pit bull is named Camellia. She herself is a faithful southern gal, on a quest for her furever home. Could it be you?\n\nWe firmly believe that Camellia lives up to the beauty of her name. She is extremely loving, well-mannered, and playful. She&#8217;s the kind of gal that can easily be the life of the party but would also prefer being in by 9pm for a quiet night on the couch! We don&#8217;t know about you but that is our kind of girl!\n\nCamellia was rescued by her foster Mom from a high-kill shelter. Her personality was just far too sweet and she wanted to give this gal a second chance at life! Since she&#8217;s been living at home with her foster Mom, Camellia has really come into bloom (pun intended). She lives in playful harmony with the resident canines. And, gosh, is it playful harmony. Camellia LOVES to play with other dogs. She would be thrilled to learn that a family with another dog wanted to adopt her! However, it's not necessary to have another dog in the home. Just a bonus for Camellia!\n\nDid we mention that Camellia has a pretty good amount of energy? What does this mean for you, her potential family, you ask? Well, it means you have a jogging partner extraordinaire. And a dog that will scale a mountain, faithfully by your side! A dog that would love running along the beach or skipping through the local dog park, stopping only occasionally to smell a few flowers and, OF COURSE, play with other dogs! \n\nCamellia is a medium to high energy girl. Smart and eager to please, she will be FUN to train. She&#8217;d be a great partner in agility training or other fun, doggy training.\n\nCamellia truly is an all around great dog. With her stunning good looks and the personality to boot, we sure hope you&#8217;ll consider applying to adopt Camellia.

Traveler is the next Bachelor. His adoring fans and all the lucky contestants competing for his heart can&#8217;t wait to see who gets the final rose from this endearing, innocent, and joyful boy. Like many Bachelor candidates before him, Traveler loves to give and get attention and to kiss humans...and other dogs! \n\nTraveler&#8217;s adorably expressive ears and charming underbite woo the ladies and gentlemen, and so does his playful, sweet, sensitive, and pure of heart personality. He loves attention and will engage his people in play by stealing something (like a dish towel, but also their hearts) while they watch and then running around to play chase. He loves fetch, he loves to walk on leash, he loves to learn, he loves car rides, he loves to get pets...there&#8217;s not much Traveler doesn&#8217;t love. He even comes when called and enjoys getting brushed! What a dreamboat.\n\nTraveler&#8217;s perfect match is a patient, loving home that&#8217;s pretty calm and quiet indoors but outdoorsy and adventurous, too. He&#8217;d be great as a solo dog who gets to socialize since he&#8217;s happiest when he&#8217;s with another dog, and he does also would be a perfect fit for a home with a confident, mellow dog whose zen ways he can mimic; with crazier dogs, he can have a little too much fun, but he takes correction well and would love to play with his high-energy friends at a dog park. His foster mom - who turns into the emoji with heart eyes when she talks about him - says he&#8217;s a diamond in the rough, and with just a little polish from a great family, he will be just as sparkly and flawless as the diamond engagement ring that comes with the final rose! \n\nCheck out his video!\nhttps:\/\/m.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=10211027892722891&id=1522178203\n \n\nName: Traveler\nBreed: Cattle Dog mix\nSex: Male\nAge: 3-4 years old\nWeight: 40 pounds\nSpayed\/Neutered: Yes\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS: \nGood with Children: Unknown\nGood with Dogs: Yes- loves other dogs but is very submissive. \nGood with Cats: Unknown\n\n\nAdoption Donation: 450.00\n\n\n \nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog.

It means that their disposition is so great, so unshakable, that they aren&#8217;t bothered by much. Baths? No problem. Chickens? Fine. Cats? Whatever. Thunderstorms? So what. Car rides? Cool. That&#8217;s Reggie: this solid, super-sweet boy is cool and calm in all sorts of situations. His foster mom hasn&#8217;t even heard him bark!\n\nReggie is a mellow guy who grew up at the K9 Savior Sanctuary in Tennessee. He was one of ten litter mates rescued from a roadside ditch when they were tiny babies, and boy, did he grow! Now a big boy with the sweetest, happiest grin, Reggie was chosen to move into one of our amazing foster homes to get ready for his forever family. Reggie&#8217;s ideal forever family will be laid-back and easygoing, just like him. He&#8217;s still figuring out how leashes work, so he may not be ready to go on hikes, but he&#8217;s making great progress, and if you rub his ears and face, he will be all yours and let you know it by ravishing you with kisses. He loves to be brushed, and he even lets his foster mom bathe him and clean his ears. He wants to look his best for all his adoring fans!\n\nIn addition to being extra-lovable and truly imperturbable, Reggie does amazingly with every dog he&#8217;s met, including young, bouncy pups who get in his face. He&#8217;s housebroken with a doggie door and so well behaved that when he&#8217;s in his kennel with the door closed but not locked, he doesn&#8217;t sneak out; he just hangs out instead. Reggie is eager to please and learns quickly, and he&#8217;s easy to please, too, happy to frolic in a big field, join you for a drive, or spend a lazy day watching TV with you (all while smiling, of course!). What more could you want than this rock-solid rock star Reggie?\n\nCheck out his adorable videos!\nm.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=10210653493563146&id=1522178203\nm.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=10210653269677549&id=1522178203\nwww.facebook.com\/deborah.h.testa\/videos\/10210702838596741\/\nhttps:\/\/m.facebook.com\/story.php?story_fbid=10210897341859201&id=1522178203\n\n\nName: Reggie\nBreed: Lab\/Rottweiler mix\nSex: Male\nAge: 8 years\nWeight: approx 85 lbs\nSpayed\/Neutered: Yes\nHeartworm: Tested Positive and Treated on 3\/27 and 3\/28\/2018\nVaccinations: Up to date \nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Dogs: Very good with other dogs, especially females.\nGood with Cats: Expected to do well; no reaction from behind kennel \nGood with Kids:  Older children, teenage years\n\n\nAdoption Donation: 300.00\n \nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog.

Now at 6 years old, she&#8217;s been moved to a foster home, is doing amazing and is available for adoption. \n\nRuby&#8217;s personality is calm, quiet, shy, loving and affectionate. She has low energy when indoors but occasionally gets a burst of joyful energy. Mornings are her favorite and when foster mom says \"you ready Ruby girl\" she prances down the hall with a big smile and tail wags (sometimes she even does a few laps). \n\nShe LOVES human company and makes the perfect lap dog and snuggle buddy.  She will nuzzle your arm or leg seeking for attention. She follows her foster mom around and always finds the best spot to be close when taking a nap. She is the perfect gardening companion and will lay next to you in the cool grass or dirt.\n\nShe has gained confidence in her new foster home and has been introduced to many new things like sleeping indoors, mirrors, TV's, couches, stairs, neighborhood walks and the beach.  She approaches each new thing timidly but with patience and gentle encouragement she has overcome many of her insecurities.  Seeing her relax, smile and roll in the grass or sand will melt your heart. She is such a sweetheart!\n\nRuby has done well with several of the dogs in her foster home but would also do fine as an only dog (less competition for your attention). She is well behaved in the car and in public settings as long as you avoid large crowds and chaos. She is extremely gentle (and slow paced) on the leash. She is housebroken.\n\nShe needs slow and proper introductions to new people. We recommend a walk around the neighborhood on neutral ground because she is nervous and fearful of new people (will shake, cower and bark if they approach to fast). When people are calm, patient, understanding and allow time for her to get to know and approach them she becomes more comfortable and will seek attention when she trusts them. \n\nRuby would do best in a quiet home without children.  She really likes a routine and a calm quiet palace to retreat when company is over. We recommend a fenced yard for Ruby because things from the outside world sometimes scare her (landscapers, garbage trucks, motorcycles, loud trucks).\n\nHer foster family just adores her and thinks she is one of the easiest and sweetest foster dogs they have ever had. She is so easy to fall in love with!\n\nIf you would like more information on this sweet, gentle dog Ruby, please submit an application, and her Adoption Coordinator will be in touch. \n\nCheck out her video below!\n\nwww.facebook.com\/deborah.h.testa\/videos\/10210696818086232\/\n\nhttps:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/FhkqNE9tP7K7QF9NA\n\nName: Ruby\nBreed: Labrador Retriever\/Shepherd mix\nSex: Female\nAge: 6 years\nWeight: 80 pounds\nSpayed\/Neutered: Yes\nVaccinations: Up to date\nHeartworm: Negative\nMicrochipped: Yes\n\nBASED ON OUR OBSERVATIONS:\nGood with Children: Ruby is timid and would do best in a quiet home without children. \nGood with Dogs: Yes, loves other dogs, but unsure at first (needs time to trust them).\nGood with Cats: Ruby is timid and afraid of cats and would do best in a home without cats.\n\n\n\nAdoption Donation: 450.00 \n\n\n \nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nInterested in a specific dog, please fill out an application if you are interested in a dog.

The number of individual inquiries is overwhelming and we are finding it difficult to respond to each one. We cannot guarantee you will receive a timely response.\n \nPaws New England is a rescue, not a shelter, and as such we do not have our dogs housed in one location - they are in foster homes both in New England and in our southern foster homes.   If you're interested in a specific dog, please complete a short online application and you will receive a reply within 48 hours so you can ask questions.\n \nAt present, if a dog is listed on our website, the dog is considered still available HOWEVER, may have applications that have come in before yours but it's still too early to know if any are a good match; therefore we encourage you to apply.\n \n\nNOTICE WITH REGARD TO LOCATION OF DOGS:  Please note: Paws New England is a foster-based rescue. We do not have a brick and mortar building to house the dogs we rescue. We have found that dogs in foster homes are much more adoptable because they have been observed in a home setting. Dogs listed with Paws New England typically reside in various locations throughout the south (primarily Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas) and New England (not necessarily in the state of Rhode Island). You will be notified by the adoption coordinator of the location of the dog you are interested in so you have the ability to decide whether to pursue adoption or not.\n\nDogs transported to New England are done so at a fee of $150.00 paid directly to the transporting company by Paws New England; no additional transport costs are responsibility of adopter. This fee is included in the adoption donation.\n\nAdoption donations cover pre-adoption vet costs (including vaccinations, spay\/neuter when age appropriate, and heartworm testing\/treatment when necessary), a microchip, and transportation to New England if necessary.\n\nDonations for our young, healthy puppies and dogs support their fellow canines of advanced age or suffering from injuries and abuse whose donations are reduced but whose veterinary costs are typically much higher. We appreciate your understanding that your dog will help others in need.\n\nAll known information about the animal is listed above.
